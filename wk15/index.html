    A resume is a brief written summary of your education, work experience, skills, and qualifications. When you apply for jobs or internships, companies request a resume as the initial step in assessing your ability to handle the duties of the job. This lesson contains some tips you can use when you write your own resume.
    
    Formatting
    Consider the following formatting options when creating a resume:
    Use 11 pt. or 12 pt. font for the body of the resume.
    Use 1-inch margins on all sides. In cases where you need more space, you can adjust the margins to .5 inches on all sides.
    Use a line of blank space between sections to allow for easier readability.
    Consider the use of italics, bold, and underlining to emphasize key points.
    Keep the resume down to one page in length and summarize the experience most relevant to the job you're applying for. In cases where you have a lot work experience, you can include up to two pages, but never more than this.
    
    Contact Information
    At the top of a resume, candidates include their name and contact information. Most of the time, an email address and phone number should be enough, but you may consider including a URL to your LinkedIn page or personal website. Another common feature in this section is your current location (city, state, and zip code). This helps recruiting managers know if relocation will be something to consider in your hiring.
    
    Education and Training
    When describing your education, make sure to include the institution you attended, the degree received, and the month and year you graduated. If you haven't graduated yet, you can still include the month and year of your expected graduation date. It's also common to mention your GPA only if it was higher than a 3.0.
    
    Experience
    Under the experience section, outline your previous work experience. This can include paid employment, paid or unpaid internships, and relevant volunteer experience. The most common way to write this is in reverse chronological order, which means that you include your most recent work experience at the top and work your way down to previous employment. Remember to include the company you worked for, your position at the company, and the months and years you were employed. Use short statements or bullet points to describe what you did at each job. It's also a good idea to include C.A.R. (Challenge, Action, Result) statements on your resume to show proof of your ability to handle difficult tasks.
    
    Certifications, Skills, and Coursework
    Many recent graduates or career changers might not have the necessary work experience to show their ability to take on a job. For this reason, some people choose to include industry certifications they've received, skills they've acquired, and any coursework that may be applicable. While you might not have the preferred years of experience, mentioning certifications, skills, and coursework communicate to potential employers your ability to learn new things and work toward achieving goals.
