    <pre>
    Network Interface	A computer component that provides a port (usually RJ-45) where a network cable can be connected.

    Network Cable	A cable that provides connectivity between network devices. A common network cable connects a computer's network interface with a wall jack.

    Physical Address	The unique, burned-into read-only memory address of a network interface. This is also called the media access control address, or MAC address. MAC addresses are burned into the read-only memory of every single network interface, such as wireless network adapters and network interface cards. This makes it virtually impossible to change the device's MAC address.

    <h3>6.2.8 Network Device and Interface Facts</h3>
    <pre>
<b>Server Type</b>
File server	- File servers provide network access to shared disk storage. They make it easier to share and backup files from a central location.
        --When a shared drive is set up on a file server, clients can access the network drive from their file system more easily by associating it with a unique letter, such as G: or N:. This is called drive mapping.
            --The shared disk storage can consist of internal drives, drives directly attached to the server, or through a Network attached storage (NAS) device. NAS devices contain one or more hard drives that users can access over the network.
        --NAS drives can be used for file sharing, backups, and even streaming media. Each NAS is controlled by some type of internal firmware (often programmed in Linux). You can plug some NAS devices into an Ethernet port, while other NAS devices can be accessed wirelessly. Since the NAS is separate from a computer, it is managed from a Web connection.

Mail server -	Mail servers provide email service to a network. In many ways, they're like virtual post offices. They store incoming mail and send outgoing messages, either to users on the same network or on other networks around the world.

Web server -	Every site you've visited on the World Wide Web, including this one, has been hosted on a web server. Web servers store web pages as hypertext documents. Whenever a webserver gets a request for one of its pages, it transmits the appropriate file to the requester using HTTP.

Database server -	Database servers store databases, which are large repositories of organized data. Clients on the network can send queries to the database server, which returns specific information about the data.
            -- Clients can also use queries to add, remove, or change data as appropriate.

Gaming server -	Gaming servers keep track of events in multiplayer video games. Most online games have players simultaneously sending inputs via their mouse and keyboard (or controller).
        --The game server receives all inputs and retransmits them to the other players. This makes the game play out in real time for everyone involved.


<b>Networking Devices</b>
Modem --	Modem is short for modulator/demodulator. Signals that arrive at your network from an Internet Service Provider (ISP), whether through fiber, cable, or phone line, can't be directly understood by your computer.
        -Instead, the signal passes through a modem that translates it into a series of electrical ones and zeros that travel through a copper wire to your computer. To upload data to the internet, the modem does the opposite, turning ones and zeros into light, cable, or phone signals.

Router --	A router's job is to send signals from one network to another. When you send an email, the signal travels through a wire or radio signal to your network's router. The router sees that data is addressed to a different network and forwards it to the ISP.
        -The ISP's router looks at the data, sees where it's supposed to go, and sends it to the router on the network where the recipient's mail server is stored.

Switch --	Similar to the way a router transfers data between networks, switches transfer data between devices within a network. Every computer on the network is connected to the switch.
        -Whenever a computer sends a signal or a signal comes in from the router, the switch looks at the data. If it recognizes the receiving computer as another device on the switch, it sends it directly to that computer. If it doesn't recognize the data, it sends it to the router.
        -A switch in a Small Office Home Office (SOHO) usually has anywhere from four to eight RJ-45 ports. A switch in the enterprise environment has 20 or more ports. Switches in the enterprise environment can be interconnected. This allows them to provide support for hundreds of connections.

Access point --	Conceptually, an access point (AP) works in a similar way to a switch; it recognizes the device that should receive the signal, then forwards the data to where it needs to go.
        -The main difference is that APs use Wi-Fi technology to connect devices to the network wirelessly; a switch uses wires.
        -In an enterprise network, the AP supports more devices than those used in a SOHO.

Firewall --	As amazing as the internet is, it's full of malicious people and software that you want to keep away from your computer. A firewall checks each bit of data (called a packet) that tries to enter your network.
        -If the firewall decides the packet's safe, it passes it along. Otherwise, it drops or rejects the packet. This firewall function is called packet filtering.

Home router -- For a small network, such as a SOHO, most people buy a single router. These are usually called wireless (Wi-Fi) routers. However, they typically combine features of several of the above devices into one device.

<b>Networking Interfaces</b>
RJ-11	The Registered Jack 11 interface (RJ-11) has four pins and a clip to hold the plug into a wall socket. RJ-11 is used to connect to a telephone line. In a DSL network, this interface connects the modem to the wall jack.
        --Many all-in-one devices that perform such services as printing, scanning, and faxing also have a RJ-11 connection. In these devices it is used for the faxing service.

RJ-45	The RJ-45 interface is much more common in today's networks. These jacks have eight pins and are a little wider than RJ-11 connectors.
        --RJ-45 is used to create a wired connection between a computer and a network. It is most often used to connect computers with Ethernet cables.

Bluetooth	Bluetooth is a technology used to create wireless connections between computers and devices. Bluetooth uses radio signals to connect devices at a short range, usually no more than ten meters.

Radio Frequency ID (RFID)	RFID, can be used for tracking objects. There are two types of RFID, passive (does not require power) and active (does require power). Passive RFID tags can be embedded in labels and stickers for tracking in manufacturing and shipping.
        --Fixed infrastructure RFID readers can scan data up to 100 feet. Handheld readers can often exceed 50+ feet. Common uses of RFID technology include placing RFID labels on products (such as clothing) to prevent theft and monitoring progress of participants in a race.

Near Field Communications (NFC)	NFC uses specially encoded tags that respond in a specific way when scanned by a radio frequency reader (peer-to-peer). NFC is a subset of RFID. As the name implies, NFC only works within a close range (about two inches).
        --If you've ever held your smartphone near a scanner to pay for an item in a store, you've used NFC. Another common use of NFC is to get product information. By scanning the NFC code, you can obtain the details about a particular item or product.


        <b>Virtual LAN (VLAN)</b>
        A virtual LAN (VLAN) is a logical grouping of computers based on a switch port. Most screened segments, also known as demilitarized zones (DMZs), are created using a VLAN. You can configure multiple VLANs with varying security requirements on one switch. This keeps the cost down.
        
        Although devices connect to the same switch, they cannot see other devices that are configured to a separate VLAN. All communication between separate VLANs must go through the router. When setting up VLANs, keep in mind:
            -VLAN membership is configured by assigning a switch port to a VLAN.
            
            -A switch can have multiple VLANs configured on it, but each switch port can be a member of only one VLAN. The one exception is described below.
            
            -VLANs can be defined on a single switch or configured on multiple interconnected switches. When interconnecting switches, a high bandwidth backbone segment is used. The backbone segments are typically between the router and the internet, as well as between the switches themselves.
            
            -With multiple switches, each switch can be configured with the same VLANs. The devices on one switch can communicate with devices on other switches if they are members of the same VLAN.
            
            -A trunk port is used to connect two switches together.
            
            -In a typical configuration with multiple VLANs, workstations in one VLAN cannot communicate with workstations in other VLANs.
            
            -To enable inter-VLAN communication, use a router or an OSI Layer 3 switch.
            
            -Using VLANs, you can create multiple IP broadcast domains on a switch. Each VLAN is in its own broadcast domain. Broadcast traffic is sent only to members of the same VLAN.
        
        A screened subnet, (demilitarized zone) is a segmented network (or subnet) that sits between the private network and an untrusted network, such as the internet. Typically:
            -Firewalls allow traffic that originates in the secured internal network into the screened subnet and through to the internet.
            -Traffic that originates in the screened subnet (low-security area) or the internet (no-security area) should not be allowed access to the intranet (high-security area).
        Because screened subnets can be challenging to access for management and administrative tasks, a server, or jumpbox, can be implemented to provide a tightly controlled access method, or jumping point, for administrators.

    <br>WPA2 is the current security standard of wifi security
    <h3>6.3.6 Wireless Standard Facts</h3>
    <pre>
        IEEE 802 Standards-	The IEEE 802 family of standards deals mostly with local area networks, and the protocols for wireless networks are found in section 11. A wireless local area network that conforms to 802.11 standards is called a Wi-Fi network. As technology has improved, so have 802.11 protocols. Over time, they have improved in several areas.
        
        Encryption Standards-	802.11 contains security protocols, which encrypt transmitted data. The first security protocol was called WEP, or Wired Equivalent Privacy. This protocol eventually became outdated and was replaced with WPA, or Wi-Fi Protected Access. This, in turn, was upgraded to WPA2, which is the most secure and is used today by virtually all secure Wi-Fi networks to provide encryption and authentication services. Below is a brief summary of each of these encryption standards:
                WEP is an optional component of the 802.11 specifications and was deployed in 1997. WEP was designed to provide wireless connections with the same security as wired connections. This encryption standard has many weakness and should never be used unless there is no other option (which may be the case with older equipment).
                WPA is the implementation name for wireless security based on initial 802.11i drafts. It was deployed in 2003. WPA was intended as an intermediate measure to take the place of WEP while a fully secured system (802.11i) was prepared. It uses Rivest Cipher (RC4) with a 128-bit key and a 48-bit initialization vector (IV) for encryption. It also uses the Temporal Key Integrity Protocol (TKIP) for encryption, making it more secure than WEP.
                WPA2 is the implementation name for wireless security that adheres to the 802.11i specifications and was deployed in 2005. This implementation is built upon the idea of Robust Secure Networks (RSN). Like WPA, it resolves the weaknesses inherent in WEP and replaces both WEP and WPA. One of the main differences between WPA and WPA2 is the use of the Advanced Encryption Standard (AES) with a 128-bit key and a 48-bit initialization vector for encryption, which is more secure than TKIP.
        
        Frequency-	Wi-Fi signals are sent using radio frequencies. Some standards, like 802.11b and g, use a 2.4 GHz band. This band has eleven channels. Unfortunately, most of these channels overlap with each other. The only non-overlapping channels are 1, 6, and 11. With only three usable channels, it was common for devices using the same network to fight over bandwidth and interfere with each other. To solve this, newer protocols, such as 802.11n and ac, started using a 5 GHz band, which has many more non-overlapping channels.
        
        Attenuation-	One of the features of a radio wave is attenuation. As a radio signal travels away from its point of origin, the signal becomes weaker. If you've ever listened to the radio in your car as you've driven out of town, you've experienced attenuation first hand. One of the drawbacks of higher-frequency bands is that they have more attenuation, and therefore cover less distance.
        
        Speed-	Another major difference between protocols is how fast they can transmit data. This is measured in bits per second. The table below compares the maximum transfer rates of several versions of the 802.11 protocol.
        
        Public Wi-Fi-	Some Wi-Fi networks, including many public networks, are unencrypted as data moves through the network as plain text. This can be extremely dangerous, as eavesdroppers can easily intercept your signals and steal your information. Some public networks provide the illusion of security by using a captive portal, which makes users agree to some terms of service before accessing the network. Don't be fooled, though; these networks are not secure.
        
        SSID-	Wireless devices use the SSID (Service Set Identification) to identify the network name. All devices on a wireless network use the same SSID. 
</pre>
    <pre>
        When comparing the different 802.11 standards, consider the following.
        
        Today, most wireless networks use either 802.11n or 802.11ac.
        
        The 5 GHz frequency provides 24 channels that do not overlap. 2.4 GHz only has 3 channels that do not overlap.
        
        Even though 5 GHz bands suffer from greater attenuation and consequently cover less distance, the significantly improved performance of 802.11n and particularly 802.11ac make them better standards in most scenarios.
        
        Bluetooth is a wireless networking standard that uses 2.4 GHz radio waves. These are the same type of radio waves used with 802.11 wireless networking, but Bluetooth has a maximum transfer rate of 1 Mbps and is used primarily for ad-hoc or impromptu connections between two devices. A typical example is a set of Bluetooth headphones that connects to a laptop computer.
        
        Configuring Wireless Networks
        -When configuring a wireless network, consider the following to increase productivity and network security:
        -In many cases, settings to determine how the clients use your wireless network will be determined through the configuration of the Wi-Fi access point (AP). Accessing the configuration of your AP is normally completed using a web configuration page. When you purchase an AP, the manufacturer will give you instruction on how to access this new device remotely. They will often have some type of program that will located the device for you, but eventually the IP address of the device will be used to access the configuration pages of the AP, allowing you to configure your device.
        -Change the default password used to configure the access point. Many APs come with a default password of admin. Since this can be learned by doing an internet search, you should change this password to ensure someone can't configure your AP.
        -Eliminate/reduce interference. If you have ever used a cell phone or a wireless computer, you have probably noticed that the Wi-Fi signals can go through such items as wood, glass, brick, and drywall. Metal roofs or other very dense material can block or reduce the Wi-Fi signals. When a Wi-Fi signal is reduced or blocked, this is known as interference. Interference can also be caused by such things as radio-based devices, other Wi-Fi networks that are close, and even electronic devices such as cordless phones, microwave ovens, and fluorescent lights. When a radio signal becomes weaker as the wave travels further from its point of origin is known as attenuation.
        -Disable SSID broadcast. This makes the network harder (but not impossible) to locate.
        -Change the SSID to something other than the default. This obscures what type of access point is in use.
        -When connecting Windows 10 to a wireless network, use the correct location. In Windows 10, selecting Private allows your computer to be hidden and disables file sharing. Selecting Public allows your computer to be discovered and enables file sharing.

    <h3>6.3.9 Bluetooth</h3>Personal Area Network (PAN)

    <pre>
    Bluetooth Pairing/Bonding
To utilize Bluetooth, two Bluetooth devices need to be paired. Pairing means to exchange of security features to ensure the connection is safe. Among other things, this includes encryption. After your devices have been paired, they no longer need to exchange this type of information and can share encrypted data. At this point, the devices are then considered to be bonded.
How you pair your devices will differ depending on the manufacture and the device. For some devices, like a mouse, you may only need to press a button located on the mouse. Other devices, such a smartphone or a Windows computer, have settings that require configuration. For example, when working with Windows 10, you can use the Settings app.

    <h3>6.5.1 Internet Protocols</h3>
    IP - Internet Protocol is a routing protocol --sends data as packets {data + a header} to another computer; receiving computer removes header and rebuilds data to complete the file
    <br> TCP = Transmission Control Protocol - Make certain items are downloaded fully; adds a TCP header to the packet {along with the IP header and data}; makes certain data arrives correctly by verifying every packet sent -- resulting in slower transfer
    speed
    <br> UDP = User Datagram Protocol -- more fast than accurate; no verification of packet receipt, so the data transfer can go faster - ex: VOIP; video streaming
    <br>DNS = Domain Name System - maps the Domain name to the IP address
    <br> HTTP - hyper-text link to other documents
    <br> HTTPS - http with SSL Secure Socket Layer
    <h3>6.5.2 Email Protocols</h3>
    SMTP - Simple Mail Transfer Protocol -- send email
    <br>POP3 - Post Office Protocol 3 -- receive email and delete from server when the message is received
    <br>IMAP - Internet Message Access Protocol -- receive email and message stays on server
    <h3>6.5.3 Facts</h3>
    <pre>
Application-	The Application layer contains high-level protocols used by processes (applications) running on a host for network communications. The Application layer integrates network functionality into the host operating system and enables network services. The Application layer does not include specific applications that provide services, but rather provides the capability for services to operate on the network.

Transport-	The Transport layer is responsible for error checking and reliable delivery. In the transport layer, each application protocol is identified by a port number. Protocols that are associated with the Transport layer include:
    -Transport Control Protocol (TCP) - Adds a header to each IP packet. The TCP header helps the receiving computer to assemble the packets into the correct configuration once the entire file is downloaded. The headers also allow the sending and receiving computers to verify with each other that each packet was received correctly.
    -User Datagram Protocol (UDP) - Is generally used when speed in transmission is more important than accuracy, such as streaming audio or video. Like TCP, UDP adds a header to each packet. However, unlike TCP, the sending computer doesn't verify that the packets were correctly received. This makes transmissions happen much faster but allows transmission errors.

Internet-	The Internet layer is responsible for forwarding packets through multiple networks. This process is called routing and is done by encapsulating the packets into internet datagrams. The Internet layer manages host addressing and routing decisions to identify how packets traverse networks. Protocols that reside at the Internet layer include:
    -Internet Protocol (IP) - As one of the main protocols in the TCP/IP suite, the IP protocol uses logically-assigned IP addresses to uniquely identify networks and network hosts. This helps in the routing of the packets between each host and network.
    -Address Resolution Protocol (ARP) - This protocol links an IP address to a host's physicals address (MAC address). For example, when you use a browser to access a site, you use the IP address (a number not too difficult to remember or use). However, to communicate with the host, the process needs to know the MAC address (hardware address) found on the interface card or device. ARP discovers the MAC address for you.
    -Internet Control Message Protocol (ICMP) - This protocol supports the TCP/IP suite. It's main job is to send error messages and other operational information to let the systems know if the data was transferred successfully or if there was an error during transmission. It is used by network devices, including routers.
    -Internet Group Management Protocol (IGMP) - This protocol is used by hosts and adjacent routers to establish multicast group memberships. IGMP is an integral part of IP multicast and allows the network to direct multicast transmissions only to hosts that have requested them.
    
Link/Network Interface-	The Link layer is responsible for describing the physical layout of the network and how messages are electrically transmitted. It is used to move information between hosts by controlling how individual bits are transmitted and received on the network medium.
    -The Link layer converts the data to be transmitted into frames by adding a Link layer header that includes physical device addressing information. Each frame processed by the Link layer includes the source MAC address and the destination MAC address. The Link layer then converts the frames into bits for transmission across the network media.
    -The Link layer corresponds to the functions of the Physical and Data Link layers of the OSI model.
</pre>
    <pre>
        DNS	Domain Name System (DNS) - Matches unique IP addresses with easy-to-read URLs. When you navigate to a website, your computer asks a DNS server to provide the IP address that corresponds to the URL you want to visit. DNS returns the correct IP address, which is then connected using the IP protocol.
        HTTP-	The Hypertext Transfer Protocol (HTTP) - Is used to identify resources and transfer hypertext pages on the World Wide Web.
        HTTPS-	Hypertext Transfer Protocol Secure (HTTPS) - Provides secure transfer over the internet. One of the biggest downsides of HTTP is that it transmits data as plain text. An attacker could intercept the signal during transmission and read the sensitive information it contains. When websites need to send or receive data securely, they use HTTPS, which combines HTTP with the Secure Sockets Layer (SSL) protocol. SSL encrypts data so unauthorized parties can't understand the data even if they manage to intercept it.  
</pre>
    <pre>
    SMTP-	Simple Mail Transfer Protocol (SMTP) - Is used to send email. When you send a message, SMTP routes it through the internet to its destination mail server. SMTP is used by all email systems that use the internet.
    POP3-	Post Office Protocol 3 (POP3) - Is one of two protocols used to receive email. When an email client uses POP3, it grabs messages from the remote server, downloads them to the local client, then deletes them from the server.
    IMAP-	Internet Message Access Protocol (IMAP) - Is a much more common receiving protocol. With IMAP, email messages stay saved on the remote mail server. This way, people can access their emails from multiple devices, such as a home computer, a work laptop, and a smartphone.
    Configuring email accounts-	When configuring an email account on your computer or smartphone, you typically need to know the host names of both the incoming and outgoing mail servers. For example, if you want to check your Gmail messages using a different mail client like Microsoft Outlook, you probably enter imap.gmail.com as the incoming mail server and smtp.gmail.com as the outgoing mail server.
    Email filtering-	Most email clients include a feature that automatically filters out junkmail. While email filtering can be implemented by each user, it can also be enabled in incoming mail services to reduce spam and other unwanted email by blocking email based on the sender address or by content.   
</pre>
    <pre>
    Domain Name System (DNS)
In addition to TCP/IP, it's important to understand the domain name system protocol (DNS). Every website on the internet has a unique address that the Internet Protocol uses to identify it. It is called an IP address. For example, the IP address for the google.com is 74.125.142.105. If you type that number into a web browser, it will take you to the Google home page. However, imagine having to type 74.125.142.105 every time you wanted to do a Google search.

DNS is a service that maps, or resolves, domain names like testout.com or google.com to their IP addresses. When you type a URL like testout.com into your browser, your computer sends a request to a DNS server asking for the website's IP address. The DNS server looks it up, then sends it back to your computer. This process is known as a DNS query.

DNS is known as a hierarchical system, meaning that several DNS servers are used to locate the desired IP address, since no one DNS server holds all the possible DNS records. These DNS servers are organized in an inverted hierarchical tree structure. At the top of the structure is the root. Under the root are several top-level domains, such as .com, .edu. org. Next comes the sub-domains that are typically assigned to companies (for profit and non-profit), such as .testout, .microsoft, .amazon, and .walmart.

As already mentioned, you are probably familiar with domain name like TestOut.com to access your favorite sites. These domain names are also called a hostname. Hostnames can contain up to 256 alphanumeric characters. They can also contain hyphens. The absolute domain name, also known as the fully qualified domain name (FQDN), specifies the exact location of the domain in the hierarchical tree. For example, myhost located in the parent domain testout.com has the fully qualified domain name of myhost.testout.com.

    <h3>6.5.4 HTTP Codes</h3>
    <pre>
 METHOD	    OPERATION	DESCRIPTION
POST	      Create	The POST method requests that a web server accept data from the user, usually to store it in a database. POST is used to submit completed web forms, including social media posts and comments.
GET	            Read	The GET method is used to retrieve data from a web server. Whenever you visit a website, your computer sends a GET request to the site's server.
PATCH	      Update	A PATCH request tells the server to make a change to an existing resource, such as editing a social media comment.
DELETE	      Delete	DELETE requests tell the server to delete the specified resource.
</pre>
    <pre>
100-199	Informational-	Informational status codes are temporary responses that let the requesting computer know that the message has been received. They're almost always immediately followed by another status code.
    Example: 101 means switching protocols. The user has asked the server to change to a different protocol, such as ftp, and the server is agreeing with the request.

200-299	Success-	A success code means that the client's request was understood and accepted.
    Example: 200 means OK. When you successfully go to a website, the server responds with code 200, which means the request was successful.

300-399	Redirection	Redirection codes mean that the user will be redirected to a different resource, usually after the user does some additional action such as clicking a link.
    Example: 301 means moved permanently. All requests to this URL should be redirected to a new URL. This is common when a company changes names or rebrands itself.

400-499	Client errors	Client error codes means the user seems to have made a mistake.
    Example: 404 means not found. The server sends a 404 error when someone requests a file that doesn't exist.

500-599	Server errors	Server error codes indicate that the web server itself is malfunctioning.
    Example: 503 means service unavailable. This code is sent when a server is either overloaded with too many requests or down for maintenance.
</pre>
    <h3>6.5.5 DHCP Dynamic Host Configuration Protocol</h3>
    <pre>
    <b>Static IP Addresses</b>
A static IP address is one that a user manually configures for a device instead of having it assigned by DHCP. The reason that it's called static is that it doesn't change in the way a dynamic IP address does. This is what you need if you want to give a device a fixed address that can be easily accessed in the future. Users often use static IP addresses for things like file servers, network printers, running a printer server, or using a remote access program.

    <b>Dynamic IP Addresses</b>
A dynamic IP address is one that's handed out by DHCP. It's called dynamic because it can change from time to time. Dynamic IP addresses are used for most home networks because they're the most cost-effective way for internet service providers (ISPs) to assign IP addresses. Instead of always giving the same IP address to your home computer, DHCP pulls from a pool of IP addresses it has at its disposal. Periodically, DHCP can assign you a new IP address when the lease for the current one expires.

    <b>DHCP Servers</b>   
A DHCP server is a network server that uses DHCP to assign IP addresses and subnet masks. It's vital that every computer on a network have a unique IP address so conflicts don't arise. If a network didn't have a DHCP server, the network administrator would have to manually set up every client who wanted to join the network. This would be a cumbersome and inefficient process, especially if they were dealing with a large network.

When a network computer comes online, it sends a message to the DHCP server to request an IP address. The server then automatically offers to lease an IP addresses to network computers in the order that it receives them. The network computer accepts the lease offer and connects to the network.

    <h3>6.5.6 Subnetting</h3> ethernet allows 1024 host on a single network.
    <br>to overcome this problem large companies with 1000s of computers divide their network into Subnets.
    <br>IP address has 2 parts: Network Address and Host Address ex: 192.168.6.2
    <br><b>Network Address</b> is like the street; it's the first part of the address: ex: 192.168
    <br><b>Host Address</b> is more specific, like the house number or host number; ex: 6.2
    <br><br> <b>Subnet Mask</b> ex: 255.255.0.0
    <br> the subnet mask defines which numbers are part of the Network (or subnet address) and which are part of the Host Address
    <br> you can decrease the possible size of your subnet by changing the Subnet Mask to 255.255.255.0 = you would then have 254 possible subnet hosts (ex: 192.168.6.1 -> 192.168.6.254)
    <br> the highest and lowest host addresses of a range are reserved. 192.168.6.0 = the Network Identifier; and 192.168.6.255 = the Broadcast Address - any messages will be sent to every host on the subnet
    <br> <br> to make an even smaller subnet then go to binary.
    <br>Subnet = 11111111.11111111.11111111.11111000 -- leaves only 3 bits for host addresses
    <br> the host address possibility above would be 001 -> 110; leaving 000 and 111 as the Special Addresses for ID and Broadcast
    <br>ex: 11000000.10101000.00000110.00000010 -- 192.168.6.00000010
    <br>in hexadecimal: Subnet Mask is now: 255.255.255.248; IP is 192.168.6.2; Net ID is 192.168.6.0 and Broadcast Add is 192.168.6.7

</pre>
    <h3>6.6.1 Application Delivery Method</h3>
    Local App Installation; Network Hosting; Cloud Hosting, SAAS -- Software as a Service
    <h3>6.6.2 Facts</h3>
    <pre>
    Local Installations-	The traditional method for delivering applications is to install them on individual desktop computer systems. Any user who wants to use the software needs a separate installation on their local hard drive. For example, a typical employee might need to install Microsoft Word, Excel, and PowerPoint; Adobe Photoshop; Google Chrome; and a number of other applications. Each of these applications needs to be maintained with security updates and bug fixes, and users need to take responsibility for backing up their documents in case their local system fails.
        -The main advantage of local installations is that they don’t require a network or Internet connection. Users can continue to do their work when the network goes down. But local systems are time consuming to maintain and difficult to back up. And if employees need to work from another location, they either need to purchase and install a second copy of the application on another computer, or they need to bring their business laptop wherever they go.
    
    Network Hosting-	One way to improve the local installation method is to allow users to save their documents and other files to a server on the local network. This makes it much easier for IT administrators to back up files. They simply schedule regular backups on the network server. Local networks can also be used to host applications, which are installed on the server and then accessed remotely from client workstations.
        -Network installations make it easier to maintain the software and regulate user access. But if the network is congested or goes down altogether, users can’t do their work. And if an employee wants to work from home, they need to set up a Virtual Private Network, or VPN, connection, which lets them log into their work computer remotely.
    
    Cloud Hosting-	A third option is to host applications and other services on the cloud. Cloud computing can include storage and processing hardware, application software, and network connectivity, all accessed over the Internet. With the cloud hosting method, applications run on hardware provided in a data center or some other location on the Internet instead of on local devices. This is great because an employee can run the application from her computer at work – and when she goes home and needs to finish a project, she can just log into her home computer, connect to the cloud, run the very same application, and access the same data – because it’s all being stored in the cloud, not on her local hard drive at work.
        -From a user's standpoint, the great thing about the cloud is its flexibility – you can use whatever device you want from wherever you are and have access to the resources you need without having to install and set everything up manually. Cloud computing is also very attractive to management and to business owners because clouds are usually set up within a pay-as-you-go system. Users can request application services or resources on-demand and then just release those resources when they're done.
    
    Software as a Service-	A related term associated with cloud hosting is Software as a Service, or SaaS. SaaS provides users with the applications they need to do their day-to-day work through the cloud. Here again, the advantage of SaaS is that you only pay for what you need. And you can experiment with new software without committing to it. You can try out an application on a rental basis, pay for the time you use it, and if you really like it, you can keep using it.
        -The main disadvantage of cloud hosting is that you need a reliable Internet connection. Some cloud subscriptions, such as Microsoft Office 365 and Adobe Creative Cloud, include locally installed versions of their apps. These allow users to work while offline, as along as they connect to the Internet every 30 days or so to verify their subscription.
</pre>
    <h3>Application Architecture Models</h3>
    tiers -- one tier (single tier) - single program running on 1 computer
    <br>two tiers - has a client and a database or file server; ex: CRM Customer Relationship Management; the Service Rep has an app running on the computer in front of them, but needs information hosted on a separate database server.
    <br>three tier and n-tier (infinite tier) - the app is hosted on an additional server or SASS, the client access the app from an outside source and the app access the database from an additional external source. best for scalability and ease of upgrade
    <h3>6.6.4 Facts</h3>
    One Tier- Many common programs run as standalone applications on a single computer. These are what we call single-tier, or one-tier, applications. They include traditional office productivity software and other programs that don’t require access to a
    separate data source. Two Tier- Business applications that store and retrieve data from a central repository typically operate more efficiently with two separate tiers: a client and a server. A common example would be a customer relationship management,
    or CRM, system. In this scenario, a sales employee runs a front-end application on her local computer, which requests customer data from the back-end database server. In other words, the graphical user interface and application logic reside on the
    client and the CRM database resides on the server. The two-tier model makes a lot of sense when data is shared across an organization. The database server typically runs a database management system, such as Oracle or SQL Server, which keeps the data
    secure, organized, and up-to-date. Three Tiers- A three-tier application would likely present the user interface on a client workstation, process data on an application server, and retrieve information from a database management system on a database
    server. The advantage of having multiple tiers includes greater scalability and flexibility for applications. Enterprise application developers can more easily update and replace just one piece of the application without having to update the other
    tiers. Businesses that host application components on their own network servers are responsible for configuring and maintaining everything themselves. Another option is to use a web hosting or cloud hosting solution, where businesses pay a subscription
    for the services they use but rely on an outside company to update and maintain application components. n-Tier- The term “n-tier” implies that application developers can theoretically add as many tiers as they need to create the most efficient services
    and processes on a network.
    <h3>6.6.5 Platforms and Licensing</h3>multiple computer systems need multi platform software
    <br>web-applications are cross platform.
    <br>Proprietary software - you only have a license to use the software; only used for fixed number of computers; personal license or enterprise license
    <br><br>Open Source Software - freely distributed, source code available; financial contributions; free base and paid add-on; training contracts
    <br><br>SASS - subscription service - automatically updates while the license is current; ex: Adobe Creative Cloud; Microsoft Office 365
    <h3>6.6.6 Facts</h3>
    <pre>
Platform compatibility-	One of the most important features of enterprise software is whether it's compatible with multiple computer platforms and operating systems.
    If an organization chooses to accommodate different computer systems for its employees, it doesn't make sense to purchase single-platform software. For example, an application designed and programmed only for Windows 10 will typically not work on Linux or Mac OS.
    
    Cross-platform software, on the other hand, is designed to work on multiple systems. It might be programmed in a platform-independent language that can be interpreted by different systems. Or the software could be compiled into different versions for different systems.
    
    Cross-platform compatibility does not necessarily mean the software will work on all systems. It could be limited to a few key hardware or software platforms.

    Web applications are usually considered cross-platform software because they're designed to run within web browsers on different operating systems.

Proprietary software-	Be aware that when you purchase proprietary software, you don't own it. You're just purchasing a license to use the software. Because you're purchasing only a license and not the software itself, you're not allowed to access the software's source code and make any modifications.
    The license you purchase usually permits you to install the software on only a fixed number of computers. These installation limits are commonly enforced by the software vendor using online software activation. When purchasing proprietary software licenses, you can usually select from two general types of licenses: personal or enterprise.
        -Personal license-	Personal licenses are aimed at home and small business customers. Usually, they allow the software to be installed on a limited number of systems, maybe one, two, or a maximum of three systems. A single-use license can be installed on only one computer.
            --Personal licenses are not the best choice for a large organization that needs to purchase hundreds or possibly even thousands of licenses for a particular software title. Trying to purchase and manage a large volume of personal licenses would be an administrative nightmare, as well as being expensive.
        -Enterprise license	To make things easier and more cost effective, many software vendors offer enterprise licenses (also called volume licenses or site licenses). Enterprise licenses allow the customer to install the software without restriction using the same activation code, typically until a specified maximum is reached.
        -Another model is to limit the number of employees who can use the software at any one time. These concurrent licenses might be a better solution for software that is used infrequently by many employees.
    Whatever licensing model an organization chooses, system administrators are responsible for monitoring and staying within the licensing agreement. Violating an agreement is software piracy.

Open source software-	Open-source software is usually freely distributed. That means you can download, install, and use the software without paying a licensing fee. This is similar to the idea of freeware or shareware, but with open source software, the source code is freely available to anybody who wants it.
        That means you can download the source code for an application, modify it, recompile it, and then use the modified version of the software. In fact, you could even post it for other users to download and use as well. You just can't resell it for profit.
            Organizations that release open-source products typically use a variety of alternative options for generating revenue. For example, they may rely on contributions. Some open-source projects will ask you to contribute financially so they can keep working.
            Open-source projects may release a base version of their software that they give away for free and offer highly-desirable add-ons for a fee. Other open-source projects may provide support or training contracts. They may release their software for free but then charge a fee for providing technical support.
            Some open-source projects will partner with a commercial organization. In this situation, two versions of the application will probably be created. One version is proprietary and another is open-source. The proprietary version is typically used to finance the development of the free version.

Software Subscriptions-	Since most software today can be installed and updated online, many software companies are moving toward a subscription model, often called Software as a Service (SaaS) or on-demand software. Users pay a monthly or annual fee to use the software and receive regular updates. The software is set up to automatically download and install updated versions as long as the subscription is current.
        Individuals and businesses can save money up front by not purchasing a perpetual software license, but they have to pay the subscription fee for as long as they want the software. Popular subscription-based apps include Microsoft Office 365 and Adobe Creative Cloud.

Licensing and Agreements-	Regardless of the platform you use for your software, you will be required to accept some sort of licensing software agreement, usually referred to as the End-User License Agreement (EULA). In most cases (unless otherwise stated) you are allowed to install and license the software on only one computer. This is known as a single use license.
        Most software requires a license or product key to unlock the software. When used, the product key generates a unique product ID or serial number. This number is often required to obtain technical support. The key is obtained after legally purchasing the software and is usually a string of characters, sometimes printed on the package or electronically sent after an on-line purchase.
        When purchasing a license that can be used by multiple people for a corporation that may have hundreds of employees, software vendors let you purchase a group license often for an unlimited number of uses. This is also known as a concurrent license.
        Concurrent licenses can be applied via the employees' network connection and are referred to as Client Access Licenses (CAL). Keep in mind that most software agreements also allow the vendor to collect and store certain data from the use of the software.
        It is also important to remember that it is illegal to copy, use, or distribute unauthorized copies of a vendor's software. This software is known as pirated software. Not only is pirated software illegal, but it often can contain bugs and sometimes viruses.
        Although not required, most vendors also want you to register the software. This often gives you added benefits, such as being able to recover you license if lost or other types of services such as technical support.

    <h3>6.6.7 Software Installation Best Practices</h3>
    <h3>6.6.8 Facts</h3>
    <pre>
CD or DVD installation-	To install an app from a CD or DVD drive, insert the disc and follow the instructions on the screen. If the installation does not begin automatically, you may need to adjust the AutoPlay settings on the computer.

After installing an app from a disc, you may need to download and install an updated version of the app from the vendor's website.
Internet installation	Before installing an app from the internet, make sure the website or publisher is a trusted source of software. Then, download the installation file and scan it for viruses and other malware.

Most anti-malware programs, such as Windows Defender, scans downloaded programs automatically. When you're confident the installation file is safe, run it and follow the instructions on the screen.
App store installation	Online app stores facilitate the purchase, downloading, and installation of apps. These include the Microsoft Store (comes preinstalled with Windows), the Google Play Store, and the Apple App Store.

Online app stores work hard to ensure that only trusted apps are available for download or purchase.
Software subscription	Software has traditionally been sold as a perpetual license installed on a user's computer. However, the subscription model has become increasingly common in recent years.

This model is often called Software as a Service (SaaS) or on-demand software. Users typically pay a monthly subscription fee to access the software over the internet.

Advantages of this method include automatic software updates, lower up-front costs, and lower hardware requirements. Popular subscription-based apps include Microsoft Office 365 and Adobe Creative Cloud.
Web application	While desktop applications are installed and configured on individual computers, web applications are delivered to computers over the internet through a web browser.

Web apps typically do not require an installation, but they need a live internet connection to function. Compared to desktop apps, web apps are often limited to a smaller subset of features. Since web apps reside on remote servers, they always include the latest software updates.
Legitimate software sources	There are many malware files that are disguised to look like legitimate software downloads. To ensure the software you download is from a reliable source, be sure you are accessing it from credible merchant, vendor app stores. or the Original Equipment Manufacturer (OEM).

If you need software that is available only from a third-party source, research the source to look for accreditation. Immediately run an anti-malware scan when you download it to check for any malicious files.
Questions to confirm credibility of sources include:

Does the website have a valid digital certificate?
Is the download secure through HTTPS?
Does the software have a vendor digital signature? Is that signature trusted by the computer?
Have you checked with others on a forum for their experience with the download?
Updates and patches	When bugs and security vulnerabilities are discovered in software, responsible vendors publish file patches or updates to fix the problems. This includes application patches, driver updates, and operating system updates.

These updates can be included in one update that can also include new features. These combined updates are called service packs on Windows. Remember to always perform a backup prior to downloading a service pack or system patch.

The best place to find software updates is on OEM websites such as Dell, HP, and Apple. Before downloading patches from a third-party website, make sure the site is legitimate.

If you install an app from a disc, it's probably already out-of-date. In this case, you'll want to download and install an updated version of the app from the vendor's website.

Cloud-based software subscriptions such as Office 365 and Adobe Creative Cloud are configured to install updates automatically as they become available. Web apps always include the latest software updates since they reside on remote servers.
Anti-malware and disabled unused features	Besides patching and updating, it's important to install anti-virus/anti-malware software to protect your hardware, and systems. Anti-malware can protect your software from corruption from malware or viruses.

Anti-malware software is especially important to update regularly. Yo protect against vulnerabilities, apply any patches as soon as you are notified.
Another best practice to limit vulnerabilities is to disable features that are not in use, as well as, remove administrative privileges that are not necessary.

Software removal	In addition to keeping the software on your computer system updated, you should also remove or uninstall software that you no longer need. You might find that an app has been installed on your system without your knowledge or that your system came preinstalled with software that you will never need or want.

Removing software and then reinstalling it can also be a way of troubleshooting software that has stopped working or is not working properly. If you are having an issue with software currently installed, you may be able to use a Repair option. If that fails or you want to remove the app for some other reason, you may need to do a clean uninstall.

A clean uninstall removes the files and settings associated with the application. This can sometimes be done with programs, such as Windows Settings app (or Control Panel), but often requires additional manual steps as specified by the app's developers.
