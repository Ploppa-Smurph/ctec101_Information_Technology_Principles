    <h3>4.4.8 Paragraph Formatting Tips</h3>
    <pre>
Line and Paragraph Spacing:  When choosing paragraph and line spacing:
   - The most commonly used academic style manuals (MLA, APA, and Chicago) require body paragraphs to be double spaced with no additional spacing between paragraphs. A notable exception to this is Chicago's block quotations style, which requires single spacing.
   - The default settings of line and paragraph spacing were designed for optimal readability. They can be used for a variety of documents: business reports, blogs, resumes, and cover sheets.
   - Line and paragraph spacing for creative documents, such as advertising flyers, should be adjusted for maximum readability based on your audience's proximity to the document.

Indentation:  Become familiar with the indentation settings that are appropriate for different contexts.
    - For formal academic papers that are double-spaced, indent the first line of each paragraph by one half inch. Single-spaced papers with extra space between paragraphs do not require first line indents.
    - By default, bullets and numbers are indented one quarter inch from the left margin, and the text for each list item is indented one half inch from the margin. In most cases, these settings are ideal, but the indents can be increased or decreased as desired.
    - Academic paper quotations that exceed four lines of text should generally be made into block quotations. Block quotations are separate paragraphs that are indented from the left margin more than regular paragraphs. Each line is equally indented from the left margin; there is no first line indent. (Rather than basing the rule on line count, APA style requires block quotations when 40 or more words are being quoted.)

Paragraph Alignment:   Consider the following guidelines when aligning paragraphs:
    - Use center alignment for titles, headlines, and short lines of text, such as poetry.
    - The body paragraphs of most documents should be left-aligned. Right alignment is usually applied only to header information, such as page numbers.
    - Use full justified text when hyphenation is required or if you prefer to have your text distributed evenly between the left and right margins.

Lists:   For bulleted or numbered lists, consider the following recommendations:
    - Use bullets to increase readability when the number of list items exceeds two.
    - Use numbers for steps and items that make the most sense when listed sequentially.
    - When list items can be broken down into subitems, consider using multilevel bullets or embedding a bulleted list within a numbered list.
    - By default, bullets and numbers are indented one quarter inch from the left margin, with the text for each list item indented one half inch from the margin. However, indents can be increased or decreased as desired.

Borders and Shading:  Consider the following guidelines for applying borders and shading to paragraphs:
    - Use shading or a border to set a paragraph apart from the rest of the document. For example, consider adding a border and shading to a document that includes an optional note or supplemental information.
    - For a flyer, you may choose to use a border to draw attention to important information such as the date, time, and location of the event.

    <h2>4.5 Formatting Pages</h2>
    watermarks, page border, multiple columns, insert and modify tab starts, dot leaders, page margins, page orientation, page break, column break, text vertically, modify hyphen options, add line numbers, format a report as a draft, format part of a document
    into columns, insert page breaks
    <pre>
1. Watermark:    A watermark is a lightly colored background image that appears in the background of a document. It can indicate the document's status, such as "Draft" or "Confidential." A watermark can also be decorative, with a company logo or other design.
2. Page Color:   The Page Color feature changes the color of every page in the document. It cannot be applied to only certain pages. If you decide to use this feature, make sure the text on the page will be readable on top of a colored background. If you plan to print a document with colored pages, be aware that you will be using a significant amount of color ink. A more practical use of the Page Color feature is to temporarily display what a document would look like if you printed it on a particular color of paper.
3. Page Borders: You may want to personalize your document by including a border around the edge of the page. Word offers many different border styles. Page borders are typically applied to creative documents, such as flyers and newsletters.



1. MarginsA margin is the amount of space between the edge of a document and the text. Word's default margin style is Normal, which leaves a one-inch space between the text and each edge of the page. You can change the margin style from the ribbon at Layout > Page Setup > Margins. There is an option at the bottom of the drop-down menu to create custom margins.
2. Page OrientationThere are two types of orientation for displaying and printing pages:
Portrait: The long edge of the paper runs from top to bottom.
Landscape: The shorter edge of the paper runs from top to bottom.
Word's default page orientation setting is portrait.
3. ColumnsA column is a vertical division of the text on a page. Newspapers and textbooks are often formatted with multiple columns per page. You can format an entire document to have multiple columns, or you can create section breaks so only certain sections have columns.
4. Page BreakWord automatically inserts a page break when the text reaches the end of a page. To break up the text before it reaches the end of the page, you can manually insert a page break by placing your cursor at the desired location and clicking Breaks > Page. With a manual page break between two pages, you can go back and add lines to the first page without moving the lines down on the second page.
5. Column BreakColumn breaks allow you to place a hard break that forces the remaining text to appear in the next column. You can insert a column break by moving your cursor to the desired location and clicking Breaks > Column.
6. Line NumbersUsing this menu, you can add a number to each line of your document. You can choose to number the whole document continuously, or restart numbering at each page or section. One common use for line numbering is when many people need to collaborate using hard copies of the same document, such as a script for a play. By using line numbers, everyone can easily navigate to the exact same line in their own copy of the document.
7. HyphenationMany books and magazines hyphenate long words at the end of a line of text. To have Word automatically hyphenate your text, open this menu and select Automatic. You can also choose Hyphenation Options to customize how your document is hyphenated.
8. Page Setup Dialog BoxMost page formatting tasks can be performed from the ribbon as well as from the Page Setup dialog box. You can perform some tasks only from the Page Setup dialog box, including:
Vertical page alignment: Text is aligned vertically to be equally spaced between the bottom and top edges of the page.
Apply to: Text formatting is applied from a certain point in the document forward, rather than to the entire document.

    <h2>4.6 Editing Documents</h2>
    spelling and grammer checker
    <br>AutoCorrect
    <pre>
AutoCorrect Spelling and Grammar: AutoCorrect changes text automatically, while the spelling and grammar check marks possible errors for you to examine and correct.
-Running the spelling and grammar check from the ribbon for your entire document is the most efficient way to correct errors. However, you can also correct errors as you type by right-clicking words or phrases that have been underlined in red or blue.
-Never accept spelling or grammar check suggestions without verifying that the changes are appropriate within the context.
-Add AutoCorrect entries for words that you frequently mistype but are not included as default entries.

Styles: Applying styles is one of the best ways to make your editing more efficient.
-You can easily change all the headings and titles in your document at once, which is especially useful in large documents.
-To change the font size, or paragraph formatting for a style, make the changes to a selection of text and then use the Update Style to Match Selection option from the Styles gallery.

Additional Editing Tips: Other editing features include find and replace tools, the thesaurus, and document statistics.
-You can use advanced search options, such as wildcards and finding similar words, by clicking the Replace button on the Home ribbon.
-Before using the Replace All button in the Find and Replace dialog box, be aware that the change you're making may not be appropriate in every context.
-If you want to edit two or more separate selections of text at the same time, hold Ctrl as you highlight each area.

    <h2>Inserting Illustrations and Other Elements</h2>
    <pre>
Integrating Images into a Document:  Use images that positively contribute to the message you are attempting to convey to your audience:
-Introduce tables, charts, and other images before they appear in the text.
-Label and number images when your document includes several images, so you can refer to the specific images from within the text.
-For online documents, use hyperlinks and pop-up windows when referring to an image that is not immediately adjacent to the text.
-Choose the most logical type of text wrapping, size, and placement for the images in your document.
-Don't overuse images in your document; too many images can make your document cluttered and hard to read.
-For creative documents, use one picture as the main focus. Use other, smaller images to support the main focus or to highlight details.

Formatting Images:  When inserting and formatting images, consider the following:
-Choose the file format with the smallest file size that also provides the quality you need. If you need part of an illustration to be transparent, use a format that supports transparency, such as GIF, PNG, or WMF.
-Add arrows, callouts, or other shapes to draw attention to areas or to clarify images.
-For high-quality printing, use images that are saved at a high resolution.

WordArt, SmartArt, and Other Illustrations:  When using WordArt, SmartArt, and other types of illustrations, consider the following:
-Use WordArt to enhance the text in creative documents.
-Use SmartArt to create flow charts, organizational charts, schematics, and other graphics that show relationships between concepts.
-Use charts to clearly communicate the meaning of data in reports and business documents.

    <h2>4.8 Creating and Formatting Tables</h2>
    <pre>
1. Table:  Tables are used to organize data into a more readable and easier to comprehend format. If you don't know exactly what the dimensions of your table need to be, you can always insert additional rows and columns later. The Add a Table tool on the Insert tab provides an easy-to-use grid to define the initial table dimensions.
2. Insert Controls:  You can add rows or columns to your table at any point in the process of formatting and entering data. When you move your cursor just above or to the left of the table, Insert Controls appear, allowing you to insert rows and columns with a single mouse click.
3. Table Data Entry:  To enter data into a cell by clicking inside the cell and typing. The Tab key moves the cursor from one cell to the next. When multiple table cells are selected, the Delete key deletes the text within each cell without deleting the actual table cells. Using the Backspace key in this same context brings up the Delete Cells dialog box, which allows you to delete table cells, rows, or columns.

1. Delete Rows/Columns: The Delete button on the Table Tools Layout tab lets you delete individual cells, rows, columns, or the entire table. With multiple cells selected, the Backspace key on the keyboard will either delete the selected cells or bring up the Delete Cells dialog box. The Delete key will not delete table cells; it solely removes textual content from the cells.
2. Merge/Split Cells: Table cells can be merged together or split into two or more cells. One of the most common reasons for merging cells is to combine cells in the top row to create a table heading. If you need an additional column in a table, you can either split the cells in an existing column or insert a new column.
3. Resize Columns: By default, all table columns are created with the same width. When the text of a cell reaches the edge of a column, the text wraps to a new line, automatically expanding the height of the row to accommodate the additional line. The cell width remains fixed unless you apply an AutoFit setting or manually change the width using the mouse or the ribbon. AutoFit Contents allows you to expand or contract columns to fit their contents without text wrapping; AutoFit Window allows columns to expand out to the margins of the page.
4. Cell Alignment: Cell contents can be aligned in nine different ways, ranging from Align Top Left to Align Bottom Right. The top and bottom alignment options will be identical to the center alignment options unless row heights are expanded beyond the default settings.
5. Convert to Text: You can convert a table to text by selecting the Convert to Text option under the Layout tab. Rows will be separated by hard returns, and columns will be separated by a delimiter of your choice (e.g., tabs, commas, etc.)

1. Table Style Options: The check boxes in the Table Style Options group can be used to modify the appearance of tables. For example, the Banded Rows check box allows you to have rows that alternate colors, which can increase the table's readability. However, this option, and many other style options, are not supported by every table style.
2. Table Styles: Tables are formatted plainly by default, but many different table styles are available on the Tables Tools Design tab. To preview how a style will change the appearance of your table, hover the cursor over the style.
3. Border Styles: The default border style of a table is a single black line, but a border's color, thickness, and line style can all be changed. Table styles usually apply their own border styles, but you can further customize them with the Border Styles tool.

    <h3>Theme and Style Sets</h3>
    <h2>4.10 Managing References</h2>
    Citations and References
    <h3>Footnotes, Endnotes, and Advanced Citations</h3>
    <pre>
1. Footnotes: Footnotes are numbered citations or comments that appear at the bottom of the page. A superscript number will appear in the text whenever a footnote is added. Chicago and Turabian are two common styles that use footnotes for citations. Add footnotes to your document with the Insert Footnote button.
2. Endnotes: Endnotes are similar to footnotes, but instead of appearing at the bottom of the page, they appear at the end of a document, chapter, or section. Use Insert Endnote to add an endnote to your document.
3. Footnote and Endnote
   Dialog Box: This dialog box is used to modify the style and formatting of footnotes and endnotes. For example, you can choose a different reference format, such as using letters or symbols instead of numbers. You can also choose to restart the numbering of notes after each page or section.
4. Citation: A citation is a formal acknowledgement that a piece of information in your paper originated from another source. Citations typically include the source's author and year of publication. For specific ideas or quotes, citations may also need page numbers. You can insert a citation into your document by using the Insert Citation button.
5. Source: In an academic paper, readers will be interested in the publication details of a cited source. Common sources include books, journal articles, and web pages. The Manage Sources button opens the Source Manager dialog box. Here, you can view the sources in your current document, as well as sources you've entered into previous documents. You can also preview citations and bibliographic entries as they'll appear with the currently selected citation style.
6. Bibliography: A bibliography is a complete list of the sources used in a document. Bibliographies typically contain more publication details than citations, such as the complete name of an article and the name of the journal in which it was published. Bibliographies are created by using the Bibliography button. Once created, a bibliography can be updated to include new sources by selecting the bibliography and then clicking Update Citations and Bibliography.
7. Citation Style: A citation style is a set of guidelines for formatting citations and bibliography entries. Citation style guidelines are typically published by academic or professional organizations. Examples include the American Psychological Association (APA), Modern Language Association (MLA), and the Chicago Manual of Style. Citation styles can be selected from the Style drop-down list.
