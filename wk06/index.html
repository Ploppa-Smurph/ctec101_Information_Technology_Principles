    <pre>
Line and Paragraph Spacing:  When choosing paragraph and line spacing:
   - The most commonly used academic style manuals (MLA, APA, and Chicago) require body paragraphs to be double spaced with no additional spacing between paragraphs. A notable exception to this is Chicago's block quotations style, which requires single spacing.
   - The default settings of line and paragraph spacing were designed for optimal readability. They can be used for a variety of documents: business reports, blogs, resumes, and cover sheets.
   - Line and paragraph spacing for creative documents, such as advertising flyers, should be adjusted for maximum readability based on your audience's proximity to the document.

Indentation:  Become familiar with the indentation settings that are appropriate for different contexts.
    - For formal academic papers that are double-spaced, indent the first line of each paragraph by one half inch. Single-spaced papers with extra space between paragraphs do not require first line indents.
    - By default, bullets and numbers are indented one quarter inch from the left margin, and the text for each list item is indented one half inch from the margin. In most cases, these settings are ideal, but the indents can be increased or decreased as desired.
    - Academic paper quotations that exceed four lines of text should generally be made into block quotations. Block quotations are separate paragraphs that are indented from the left margin more than regular paragraphs. Each line is equally indented from the left margin; there is no first line indent. (Rather than basing the rule on line count, APA style requires block quotations when 40 or more words are being quoted.)

Paragraph Alignment:   Consider the following guidelines when aligning paragraphs:
    - Use center alignment for titles, headlines, and short lines of text, such as poetry.
    - The body paragraphs of most documents should be left-aligned. Right alignment is usually applied only to header information, such as page numbers.
    - Use full justified text when hyphenation is required or if you prefer to have your text distributed evenly between the left and right margins.

Lists:   For bulleted or numbered lists, consider the following recommendations:
    - Use bullets to increase readability when the number of list items exceeds two.
    - Use numbers for steps and items that make the most sense when listed sequentially.
    - When list items can be broken down into subitems, consider using multilevel bullets or embedding a bulleted list within a numbered list.
    - By default, bullets and numbers are indented one quarter inch from the left margin, with the text for each list item indented one half inch from the margin. However, indents can be increased or decreased as desired.

Borders and Shading:  Consider the following guidelines for applying borders and shading to paragraphs:
    - Use shading or a border to set a paragraph apart from the rest of the document. For example, consider adding a border and shading to a document that includes an optional note or supplemental information.
    - For a flyer, you may choose to use a border to draw attention to important information such as the date, time, and location of the event.
