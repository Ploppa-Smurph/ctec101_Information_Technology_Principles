    we live in the information age and with the advent of computers we have shifted from traditional industry into information technology.
    <br> computers, at their most basic level: take input from user, process the information, and then output, or store, the results.
    <h4> 2.2.2 - Computer Functions</h4>
    <b>Input</b> - before a computer can work it needs input from a user. input is the act of physically putting data into a computer. inputs are often used to send commands to the software application that in turns stores data in 'system memory', aka
    Random Access Memory (RAM). Input
    <br><br><b>Data Processing</b> - when input is received the operating system in the computer performs calculations on the input and converts the raw electrical signals into information that can be used.
    <br>The information is often stored in RAM. Data Processing occurs when the CPU retrieves the information from RAM and manipulates it according to instructions from an application. After processing is complete the changed info is stored in RAM.
    <br><br><b>Output</b> - 1 option that a computer has to deal with the data returned to the user - as an image on a screen, sound through speakers, or pages to a printer.
    <br><br><b>Storage</b> - a 2nd option for dealing with data, save it to physical memory to deal with later.
    <h4>2.2.3 - History of Computers</h4>
    Herman Hollerith made the first "Tabulating Machine" to compile the census data in 1890. It was a punch card machine. Hollerith's company later became IBM (International Business Machines).
    <br>pre 1947 computers were very large and relied on Vacuum Tubes to relay information through the system. in 1947 Bell Labs created Transistors
    <br>Transistors were able to replace the bulky Vacuum tubes. Transistors were made of Silicon and started production in California's Santa Clara Valley, that is why the area is known as Silicone Valley.
    <br>in 1959, Jack Kilby invented the microchip. microchips allowed computers to be produced on a single board as opposed to a room full of equipment and paved the way for Personal Computers.
    <br>in 1977 3 successful Personal Computers were released: Apple 2, TRS 80, and the Commodore Pet(??) 2001. 4 years later IBM came out with the PC.
    <br>at first the PCs were mostly used for work, especially for word processing. In the early 80's the popularity of Video Games led to the rise of Arcades.
    <br>wordprocessing remained the primary use for personal computers until the mid-90's when the World Wide Web became popular.
    <br>the internet was huge, but relied on access to desktop or laptop computers until 2007 when Apple released the 1st Smartphone, the Apple IPhone.
    <br>most telephones sold today are smartphones (which are small, powerful computers).
    <h4>2.2.4 - Computer Facts</h4>
    </p>
    <p>Table 1: Timeline of Important Events in Computer History
        <br>
        <br> <b>1890</b> - Hollerith's Tabulating Machine At the end of the 19th century, the population of the United States was rapidly growing. Because there were so many people, the 1880 census took seven years to compile, and it was predicted that
        the 1890 census would take nearly twice as long. To solve this problem, the government hired Herman Hollerith to devise a solution. Hollerith created an electromechanical tabulating machine to process the census data. It worked by punching data
        into paper cards, then inserting them into the machine. Inside the machine, small metal pins would pass through the holes into a vial of mercury, completing an electrical circuit. This in turn powered an electric motor, which turned the appropriate
        gear in the machine to keep track of the count. Using this machine, the entire census was compiled in two and a half years.
        <br> <b>1944</b> - Harvard Mark 1 Completed Working together, engineers from Harvard University and IBM created the Harvard Mark 1, which at the time was the most powerful computing machine ever built. It was fifty feet long, weighed five tons,
        and was built from about 750,000 individual mechanical parts. The Mark 1 was used by the Allies during World War II and assisted in creating simulations for the Manhattan Project. It could perform three additions or subtractions every second and
        one multiplication every six seconds.
        <br> <b>1947</b> - First Transistor Developed Early computers sent signals via mechanical relays. Relays were metal switches that would physically move to make and break electrical circuits, representing 1s and 0s. Because the parts had to physically
        move, they were slow and tended to wear down over time. In 1947, scientists at Bell Laboratories invented the transistor. Transistors contain silicon, a semiconductor that can be made to sometimes conduct electricity and sometimes not. Because
        they didn't have any moving parts, silicon transistors were smaller, faster, cheaper, and more durable than mechanical relays.
        <br> <b>1959</b> - Invention of the Microchip Throughout the 1950s, computers were large and expensive. Most computers were owned by governments, universities, and businesses - they had no place in the typical home. Then, in 1959, researchers
        at Texas Instruments developed an integrated circuit, or microchip. This new technology allowed an entire computer to be built into a single board, rather than needing large modules for each part of the computer. Microchips paved the way for personal
        computer ownership.
        <br> <b>1977</b> - The Personal Computer Revolution In 1977, three successful personal computers were released to the public: The Apple II, the TRS-80 Model 1, and the Commodore Pet 2001. These three computers became known as the "1977 trinity."
        1977 also saw the release of the Atari 2600, the first popular home video game console. For the first time, computers were marketed to the general public rather than just businesses and hobbyists. Four years later, IBM followed up with the IBM
        PC, giving birth to the PC/Apple rivalry that still exists today.
        <br> <b>1994</b> - The World Wide Web Personal computer ownership began to skyrocket in the mid-nineties with the advent and rise of the World Wide Web, which began in 1991. In 1994, the web became public, and the world got a lot smaller. With
        new technology like email and chatrooms, computers became a viable way of communicating with other people and thus became more popular. In the early 2000s, social media sites like MySpace and Facebook were launched.
        <br> <b>2007</b> - Smart Phones Through the mid 2000s, Internet access was mostly limited to computers and laptops. Then, in 2007, Apple unveiled the iPhone, the world's first smartphone. Now, people could access the Internet anywhere. Smartphones
        are now extremely common in the developed world, almost completely replacing other kinds of personal telephones.
    </p>
    <h4>2.2.5 - Supercomputers</h4>
    the fastest, most powerful computers that exist at a given time.
    <p><b>Naval Ordnance Research Calculator</b> in 1954 IBM created the first Supercomputer called NORC (Naval Ordnance Research Calculator).
        <br>it was the most powerful computer on earth from 1954 - 1963 with the power to store 2,000 words in it's electrostatic memory tubes. It had a access time of 8 microseconds
        <br>NORC ended up in Dahlgren, Virginia and at it's presentation ceremony on December 2nd, 1954 NORC calculated Pi to 3,089 digits in 13 minutes, which was a record at the time.</p>
    <p><b>CDC600 and CDC7600</b> in 1965 Seymour Cray @ Control Data Corporation built the CDC600 which could execute 3,000,000 instructions per second - 10x faster than any computer at the time.
        <br>in 1967 the successor, CDC7600 was built. CDC7600 used 'Pipelining', which is the ability to run several states of an instruction at the same time to increase performance.
        <br> the 7600 was 10x faster than the 6600 and was regarded as the fastest computer in the world at the time. it was still reported to break down once a day.
    </p>
    <p><b>ILLIAC IV</b> in 1964 the Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency (DARPA) founded a project at the University of Illinois called ILLIAC IV
        <br>the project was completed in 1972 and was the first to use Solid State Memory. ILLIAC IV was the first network-available supercomputer. On September 7th, 1981, after 10 years in operation, the ILLIAC IV was turned off.
    </p>
    <p><b>Cray Research, Inc</b> in 1972 Seymour Cray left CDC and opened Cray Research in his home in Chippewa Falls, Wisconsin.
        <br>The Cray-1 was built in 1975 and boasted world-record speeds of 160 megaflops and had 8mb of main memory. It was a Vector Computer with only one main processor that was optimized to do the same instruction on several pieces of data.
        <br> Cray Research is still around and made breakthroughs throughout the 90's. Cray has partnered with AMD to create 'Frontier' the world's fastest supercomputer (to be completed in 2022)
    </p>
    <h4>2.2.6 - Human-Computer Interaction</h4>
    Human-Computer Interaction (HCI) is a field of study that looks at how computers and other technology interact with humans.
    <br> Focus on User-Centered Design (UCD), a process where the Design team takes on the needs of the end user at every phase of the process. UCD products are as accessible as possible.
    <br> HCI also informs User Interface (UI) which is a design process that concentrates mainly on the look or style of a program. UI seeks to create a visual experience for the user that will be simple to use, enjoyable to look at, and meaningful.
    <br> ex: a software company is developing a word processing program - they would need to think about an interface style that was simple and intuitive while still offering the features that users are looking for. you need editing tools, multimedia
    support, and secure backups.
    <br> the development team will take into account the details like making certain the interface isn't overwhelming and that fonts are large enough.
    <p>the Questions of Human-Computer Interaction
        <br><br> 1. Why are people using computers? what motivates them and what do they value?

        <br><br> 2. What do people want to do with computers? what functionality and features do they need?

        <br><br> 3. How are people using computers? how can they access what they want? what sort of aesthetics do they expect?
        <h5>Principles for Measuring Human-Computer Interaction</h5>
        <ul>
            <li><b>Usability</b> - refers to how suitable the computer is for the task and how easy it is to learn</li>
            <li><b>Effectiveness</b> - what percentage of a goal the computer is able to achieve. How good is the computer at doing the task that needs to be accomplished?</li>
            <li><b>Efficiency</b> - how much time it takes the computer to complete a task. also looks at how much time the user has to take correcting errors.</li>
            <li><b>Satisfaction</b> - how happy the user is with how the computer functioned. was the user satisfied with each step of the process?</li>
        </ul>
    </p>
    <h2>2.3 - Digital Data</h2>
    Key Terms:
    <ul>
        <li><b>Decimal System</b> - numbering system that uses ten digits, 0-9</li>
        <li><b>Binary System</b> - numbering system with two digits, 0 and 1</li>
        <li><b>Hexadecimal System</b> - numbering system with sixteen digits, 0-9 and A through F</li>
        <li><b>Bit</b> - the smallest unit of digital information, represented by 1 or 0</li>
        <li><b>Byte</b> - group of 8 bits joined together</li>
        <li><b>Digital Data</b> - physical signal, such as text, number, graphic, or sound, interpreted by converting it into binary numbers</li>
        <li><b>Encoded Integers</b> - representation for integers using a group of bytes. Normally, one bit in one of the bytes represents the sign, 1 for negative and 0 for positive. the remaining 31 bits are used to encode the number itself using binary
            digits
        </li>
        <li><b>Encoded Text</b> - representation of text by assigning a unique binary code to each character</li>
        <li><b>Processor Speed</b> - speed at which the computer can process information as measured by the number of cycles per second (Hertz) that the computer CPU operates at. Processor Speed is measured in Kilohertz, Megahertz, or Gigahertz</li>
        <li><b>Storage Space</b> - measurement in bytes of the volume of storage a device contains. Measured in kilobytes (1024 bytes), megabytes (1024 kilobytes), gigabytes (1024 megabytes), and terabytes (1024 gigabytes)</li>
        <li><b>Throughput</b> - measurement in bits per second that information is transferred through a network from one computer to another. Measured in Kbps (kilobits/second), Mbps (megabits/second), and Gbps (gigabits/second) </li>
        <li><b>ASCII</b> - American Standard Code for Information Interchange. unique 7-bit binary code to represent characters on the internet. Extended ASCII uses 8-bit binary code for international characters</li>
        <li><b>Unicode</b> - International 16-bit encoding standard that accommodates character sets from multiple languages</li>
    </ul>
    8-bit graphics are limited to 256 colors since 1 byte has 256 combinations. computers today run on 32 or 64 bit architecture, meaning 32bit systems have almost 4.3 billion combinations, and 64bit uses the 24bit color and 8bit of z-buffer data (alpha transparency)
    <br>4,294,967,295 is the possible amount of character combinations in 32bit systems, that is equal to 32 1s in binary. in binary in order to tell if an integer is positive or negative the first bit of data is marked as 0 = positive, or 1 = negative.
    this gives a range of -2.1 billion to +2.1 billion
    <p>computers interpret digital signals as 1 and 0 - that is a single bit of information. 8 bits of data form 1 byte.
        <br>bits can be used to represent text and numbers with binary code. we then discussed units of measure for Storage, Throughput, and Processing Speed</p>
    <h3>2.3.4 - Digital Information Facts</h3>
    Computers work by translating physical signals, such as electrical charges into digital information.<br>
    <ul>
        <li><b>Bit</b> - smallest unit of digital information - each 1 or 0 in a binary sequence is 1 bit</li>
        <li><b>Byte</b> - 8 bits form a byte -- the value of a byte can range from 0 (eight 0s) to 255 (eight 1s)</li>
        <li><b>Kilobyte (KB)</b> - one Kilobyte is equal to 1024 bytes</li>
        <li><b>Megabyte (MB)</b> - one Megabyte equals 1024 Kilobytes, or 1 million bytes</li>
        <li><b>Gigabyte (GB)</b> - one billion bytes, or 1024 Megabytes</li>
        <li><b>Terabyte (TB)</b> - 1024 Gigabytes, or a trillion bytes</li>
        <li><b>Digital Data</b> - a physical signal such as text, number, graphic, or sound - interpreted by converting into binary numbers</li>
        <li><b>Encoding Integers</b> - since integers have a positive or negative value computers encode 32bit by using the first bit for the sign, 0 = positive and 1 = negative. the remaining 31 bits are used to encode the number. there is a range of -2.1
            billion to +2.1 billion </li>
        <li><b>Encoding Text</b> - computers encode text by assigning a unique binary code to each character</li>
        <li><b>Processing Speed</b> - 64 bit processors computers can receive or send 8 bytes of data at once. Each time the processor writes to memory or reads data from memory is a cycle. the base unit is the hertz (Hz). 1 hertz is 1 cycle / second<br>            1 kilohertz (KHz) = 1000 Hz; 1 megahertz (MHz) = 1 million HZ - seen on older PC Bus interfaces; 1 gigahertz (GHz) = 1 billion Hz </li>
        <li><b>Storage Space</b> - refers to bytes, since bits and bytes are so small we use a metric system to describe the groups, Kilobyte, Megabyte, Gigabyte, and Terabyte (each 1024 times larger than the group before)</li>
        <li><b>Throughput</b> - Data transmission from 1 computer to the other - a gigabit internet connection can send 1 billion 0s and 1s per second. It also has to do with the PC Bus speed - the bus speed is how quickly the system can move data from one
            component to another. Gigabit speed is what is common in many modern modems, Megabit is stil very common for home networks, Terabit (Tbps) is used to link data centers and cities</li>
        <li><b>System Memory</b> - RAM is volatile and clears data when the computer shuts down.
            <ul>
                <li>DRAM - Dynamic ram; SDRAM - Synchronous DRAM - is dynamic RAM that is synchronized with system bus; Dual Inline Memory Module (DIMM) - is a stick made of several DRAM circuits - used for SDRAM in Desktop PC; (SO-DIMM) - Small Outline DIMM
                    - are used in laptops</li>
            </ul>

    <h3>2.3.5 - Data Representation - TEXT ENCODING STANDARDS - ASCII & UNICODE</h3>
    ASCII & Unicode
    <p>ASCII is 7 bit code that can hold 128 characters (7 0s all the way to 7 1s)<br>is: S = 83; s = 115; $ = 36
        <br><b>Extended ASCII</b> was created to use the 8th bit, encompassing characters 128 -255; Extended ASCII includes accented letters and math symbols
        <br><br><b>Unicode</b> was released in 1992 to alleviate the limitations of sending ASCII code between different nations.<br> Unicode is 16 bit and can represent millions of characters.
    </p>
    <h3>2.3.6 - Data Representation Facts</h3>
    ASCII - developed in 1963. ASCII is seven-bit code and represents 128 characters (from 7 0s - 7 1s).
    <br>Each letter and symbol is assigned a number (0-127). Extended ASCII was developed to represent accented letters and additional symbols (128-255).
    <br><br>Unicode - was developed in 1992, using 16-bit encoding and is capable of representing millions of characters. Emojis are Unicode characters.
    <br> Unicode can employ different encoding stanards - that is what: UTF-8; UTF-16; and UTF-32 are. UTF-8 & UTF-16 are the most common -- websites often use UTF-8 encoding.

    <br><br> <b>KEY TERMS</b>
    <br><br>
    <ul>
        <li><b>Sample</b> - part of a sound wave that is captured, measured, and assigned a numeric value during digital sound recording</li>
        <li><b>Bit Depth</b> - amount of memory used to store the numeric value of a sound sample during digital sound recording. 8-bit sound uses 1 byte to store the value of each sample. 16-bit uses 2 bytes per sample. the higher the bit depth, the better
            the sound, generally speaking. </li>
        <li><b>Sampling Rate</b> - the number of individual samples taken each second during digital recording. Measured in Hertz, higher the sample rate, the better the recording. most modern recordings are 44.1Hz.</li>
        <li><b>Frame Rate</b> - Number of images, or frames, that are taken each second during digital video recording, most digital videos average 30 FPS, with a push towards 60 FPS in gaming and high def</li>
        <li><b>Resolution</b> - number of pixels in the width and height of each frame in a digital video recording, the higher the resolution, the clearer the image.</li>
        <li><b>Color Depth</b> - amount of memory computer uses to display colors in a digital image or video. 8-bit color images use one byte of data for each pixel. 24-bit color uses 3 bytes for each pixel.</li>
        <li><b>RGB Display</b> - display on a computer monitor that is made up of sets of tiny red, green, and blue (RGB) lights, easch set combining to make a pixel. a pixe will display different colors depending on the brightness of each light</li>
        <li><b>Raster Images</b> - images stored by dividing a picture into rows of pixels and collecting the color values of each pixel, in order, row-by-row</li>
        <li><b>Vector Images</b> - images stored by mathematically describing the shapes in the image. a circle might be stored as a center point and the distance from the center point to the circle's edge; a square will be saved as 4 lines each with a beginning
            point and a length.</li>
        <li><b>File Compression</b> - way to reduce the size of files making them easier to store</li>
        <li><b>Lossless Compression</b> - compression algorithm, such as GIF, PNG, PDF, and ZIP, that doesn't affect the original data.</li>
        <li><b>Lossy Compression</b> - compression algorithm, such as JPG, MP3, MP4 that slightly alter the data to make it easier to store, taking advantage of the limitations of human sight and hearing, and is usually used for images, videos, and audio
            files
        </li>
        <li><b>Run-Length Encoding</b> - common lossless compression algorithm that looks for repeated patterns of bits or bytes and records the pattern and then number of times the pattern is repeated</li>
        <li><b>Compression Artifact</b> - patch of pixels in a compress image or video that have less visable detail than the rest of the image</li>
        <li><b>Bitrate</b> - Kilobits of audio data processed each second</li>

        <li><b>Rendering</b> - second step in designing a 3D model which converts the models int 2D images on a computer</li>
        <li><b>Ray Tracing</b> - advanced rendering method that is used to create incredibly realistic lighting effects for things like video games and movies</li>
    </ul>
    <h3>2.4.1 - Digital Sound and Video</h3> in the past audio and video was recorded physically using analog techniques, now it is recorded digitally and encoded through 1 and 0s.
    <br> soundwaves are smooth curves and are stored as smooth curves when recording analog. In digital recording we talk about <b>bit depth</b>, or how many bits are used to encode 1 sample
    <br> early computers used 8 bits to encode 1 sample, so each sample had 256 possible values. Today most computers use 16 bit audio with 65,535 possible values. The higher the bit rate the better the sound quality.

    <br><b>Sampling Rate</b> sampling rate details how many samples are taken per second 1000 samples per second would be 1KHz and would not sound very good, most modern music is recorded in at least 44.1 KHz.
    <br>the higher the Sample Rate or Bit Rate, the larger the filesize. The reason that High Fidelity Audio files are so large is because they contain high bit rate, and sample rate.

    <p><b>Video</b><br>Video is still image shown very quickly so that it tricks your brain into believing it is moving. Video quality is determined by Frame Rate, Resolution, and Color-Depth.
        <br> <b>Frame Rate</b> is the measure of how many frames are shown per second, the higher the frame rate, the smoother the motion - most video is in 30FPS.
        <br> Resolution is the amount of pixels in each individual image, higher resolution images are clearer and take more storage.
        <br> Color Depth - 8 bit color uses 1 byte per pixel limiting to 256 colors; whereas 24-bit color uses 3 bytes of data and can represent millions of colors.
        <br> the better the color depth the more realistic the video will appear, and the larger the video will be.

    <br><br> Aspect Ratio is the proportion between width and height. common ratios are 4:3 - analog TV broadcast; 16:9 - HDTV and Production Films; 16:10 - Computer Display
    <br>Display Devices -- LCD - Liquid Crystal Display - work by having backlight reflect through liquid crystals.
    <br><br> Touchscreens are capacitive. they are configured through software to support multi-touch events. used in handheld devices and kiosk
    <br><br> Digital Projectors - some use DLP (Digital Light Processing) technology that uses mirror along with light and color filters to display an image on a screen

    <h3>2.4.3 - File Compression</h3>
    <br> Run-Length Encoding - takes advantage of the fact that multiple pixels of the same color are normally by each other and instead of storing (ex: red, red, red, red, red, red -- the area will be saved as 6red (denoting 6 red spaces))
    <br> Run-Length Encoding is a Lossless compression <b>Algorithm</b> and makes no changes to the original file. Zip, PDF, PNG, and GIF are all examples of Lossless Compression. The
    <br><br> Lossy Compression does change the file a small amount. Lossy compression takes advantage of the fact that human sight and hearing is imperfect. JPG is the most common Lossy image type, MP3 and MP4 are Lossy Audio and Video formats.
    <br> in video when a background (or other pixels in the frame) do not change from frame to frame it is called Temporal Redundancy and Lossy video compression can take advantage of that to improve file size. errors that arise due to video being too
    compressed are called Compression Artifacts.
    <br><br>Most audio compression techniques discard data in the ultrasonic range since humans cannot hear in that range, but they strive to keep data in the vocal range.
    <br>audio on telephones is compressed to limit the amount do data being transmitted so more people can use phone service at one time.
    <h3>2.4.4 - File Compression Facts</h3>
    <h3>2.4.5 - Digtial Audio Formats </h3>
    <ul>
        <li>Bitrate</li> - kilobits of audio data process each second.
        <li>WAV / AIFF - Waveform Audio File (WAV) was created in 1991 by Microsoft and IBM. Apple Created AIFF (Audio Interchange File Format). These audio formats are uncompressed and are used for TV, Radio, and media that needs quality files for editing.</li>
        <li>MP3 / AAC - MPEG Layer 3 is a format of Lossy data compression, developed by the Moving Pictures Experts Group (MPEG). MP3 uses 'audio masking' to reduce file size of audio files. Patented in November 1996.
            <br>in 1997 a patent was filed for AAC (Advanced Audio Coding) which is similar but uses a more complex compression algorithm for better sound quality. AAC is used by YouTube, Android, iOS, iTunes, and gaming systems because of it's small
            size and excellent quality. </li>
        <li>WMA - Windows Media Audio was released in 1999 - it is not used freely, but does have higher quality compression at lower bitrate.</li>
        <li>MIDI - Musical Instrument Digital Interface don't contain audio waves. MIDI files contain the instructions of which notes are played, when they are played, and how long they are to be held. </li>
    </ul>
    <h3>2.4.6 - Digital Video Formats</h3>
    <b>Video Codec</b> - the codec is a piece of software that either compresses or decompresses digital media. Most codecs have 2 components:
    <br>-- an <b>encoder</b> = that compresses the information for easier storage and sharing
    <br>-- and the <b>decoder</b> - that decompresses the file to play back.
    <br> there will be a video and audio codec to handle both the image and the audio files that comprise a video.
    <br><br>MPEG-4 is a commonly used video codec that uses an advanced compression algorithm. DivX is a movie encoding codec that utilizes certain MPEG-4 files and compresses the movie to fit on a single DVD. DivX HD does the same for HD movies.
    <h4>Video Formats</h4>
    some formats are compressed while others are not (Lossy vs Lossless). <br>
    <b>MP4</b> - common for internet video because of the small file size. one of the most common formats.
    <b>AVI</b> - Audio Video Interleave. created in 1992 by Microsoft for Windows. AVI are made of small container files known as RIFF (Resource Interchange File Format) files which divide each AVI file's data into smaller chunks. Each chunk of the AVI
    file contains
    <br>metadata about the file (such as dimension and frame rate) and a second chunk that includes the audio and visual data. AVI files are NOT compressed and can become large, not used much outside of Windows because of limitations compared to modern
    formats, like MP4.
    <br><b>WMV</b> - Compressed video storage format developed by Microsoft for the Microsoft Advanced Systems Format (ASF). compressed and encoded by Microsoft codecs, you need additional software to play these files on Mac computers.
    </>
    <h3>2.4.7 - Digital Images</h3>
    Raster and Vector Graphics - when all 3 lights of a pixel (Red, Green, Blue) [RGB] are on (set to 255) then the pixel displays white.
    <br><b>Raster</b> - these are BitMap images and are the most common. Raster images save every pixel of information and can be very detailed, therefore very large in size. they also do not scale up well. Small raster images will appear pixelated when
    scaled up.
    <br><b>Vector</b> - 3D movies and video games use vector graphics (so do logos), as well as fonts. Instead of storing each pixel of information, vector graphics draw using circles and curves. Vector graphics are highly scalable and do not lose detail
    when stretched or scaled up.
    <br> The filesize is normally samller than raster images, making vector files easier to store. Vector graphics are not as easy to create as raster images and vector images do not include the same level of detail as rater images, most only contain
    a few colors and shapes.
    <h3>2.4.8 - Digital Image Facts</h3>
    RGB Display, Raster, Vector
    <h3>2.4.9 - Digital Image Formats</h3>
    <br><b>.jpg</b> - JPEG (Joint Photograhic Experts Group) is the most common. Compressed file type that reduces size 20:1 without sacrificing too much image quality (lossy). Supports 24-bit color. Easy to share and popular.
    <br><b>.png</b> - Portable Network Graphics is a raster file format. Lossless compression of images. Released in 1994 to improve GIF format. Supports 24-bit color and an 'alpha channel' that allows transparency levels in an image. PNG cannot be animated
    like GIF.
    <br><b>.gif</b> - Graphics Interchange Format, released in 1987 by CompuServ. Lossless format that is often used for web images. GIF is used for icons and buttons because the limited color palette still looks good. Today GIF is mostly used for small
    animated image files.
    <br><b>.tiff</b> - Tagged Image Fiie Format, created in 1986 for storing raster graphics. Created by Aldus (later Adobe), Microsoft, and Hewlett-Packard. TIFF has NO compression and is the ideal format for high-quality printing. Modern web browsers
    DO NOT support the format without plugins.
    <h3>2.4.10 - 3D Models</h3>
    3D models are used in movies and video games. They are used by manufacturers to create new products before production, and the can be used to 3D print solid objects.
    <br><br><b>Wireframes</b> - 1st step in 3D modeling, provides outline of model, including vertices and lines without including any surface, texture, or lighting.
    <br> wireframes are skeletons. The models are created by connecting points (known as vertices) with lines (known as paths). These lines create 3-Dimensional polygons.
    <br> Wireframes are easier for computers to manipulate, so animators create the wireframe and then fully render the model with more powerful computers later.
    <br><br><b>Rendering</b> - the 2nd step of the process is rendering, or taking a 3D model and converting it to a 2D image on the computer. Images are rendered for stills, or for animated video. Rendering can take a great deal of time and computer
    resources.
    <br><br><b>Ray Tracing</b> - this is an advanced rendering method used to create realistic lighting effects for video games and movies.

    <h3>2.4.11 - Activity: Compare Digital Media</h3>

    1. explain concept of sampling and sample rate, then listen to a 2kHz, 8kHz, and 44.1kHz file (given on site).
    <br>2. explain compression and lossy versus lossless compression. then compare 2 images (given on site)
    <br>3. explain 'bit depth' in audio recordings. listen to an 8-bit, then a 32-bit recording (on site)
    <br>4. describe difference between raster and vector images. then view them (on site)
    <br>5. describe concept of image resolution, then compare 94x140 image to 604 x 900 image (on site)

    <br><br> -- Digital sound recordings capture a sound wave and divide it in into distinct segments, the recording then assigns a value to each segment; a single segment's value is called it's <b>Sample Height</b>.
    <br>The program then decides how much memory to allocate to store the value of each sample - that amount is called <b>Bit Depth</b>
    <br> The <b>sample rate</b> is how many individual samples are taken each second, measured in hertz (Hz).

    <br><br> text documents and computer programs need to be stored with 'Lossless' compression so they do not corrupt data.
