Creating Workbooks: Workbooks are the name for individual Excel files. Each workbook can be composed of one or more worksheets. When creating a new workbook, you can choose from hundreds of useful templates, or you can create a new workbook from scratch.

Managing Worksheets: A single workbook can contain multiple worksheets. Think of a worksheet as a single page of your workbook. Dividing information into different worksheets keeps your information neat and organized.

Entering Data: Always keep your information organized when you make a spreadsheet, especially when working with large amounts of data.

Protecting Worksheets: To protect workbooks and worksheets from changes, focus on the particular cells that you want to protect and the cells that you want to edit.

Printing Worksheets: Even though printing isn't its primary function, Excel has several tools and options you can use to print great-looking spreadsheets.

Formatting Cells: An important part of spreadsheet creation is formatting and design. Formatting cells includes borders, colors, and number formatting (such as percentages and decimal places shown).

Entering Simple Formulas: Excel can do everything a calculator can, but Excel is much faster when you are working with large amounts of data. Formulas are used to generate calculations from data within a workbook.

Using Advanced Functions: In addition to basic math operations, Excel can perform a variety of logical tests and other analyses on your data by using advanced functions.

Creating Charts: Charts are the best way to visually represent your data. Charts make it much easier to spot an important trend or pattern that would otherwise be missed when looking at numbers alone. Excel can create almost any type of chart for your spreadsheets.

Organizing Data in Tables: Excel can take an existing array of data and automatically format it into a table. Tables make it easy to organize, sort, filter, and total your data.

Summarizing Complex Data: Outlines provide a great way to group and summarize transactional data on a worksheet. PivotTables provide a convenient way to ask questions about complex data and display results in a custom report.

    <pre> Workhsheet Management<br>
    1. Worksheet: A worksheet is an individual spreadsheet within a workbook. There is no limit to the number of worksheets a single workbook can contain. Each worksheet has its own tab at the bottom of the screen. These tabs can be rearranged by dragging them.
    2. New Worksheet: Create a new blank worksheet by clicking the New sheet button.
    3. Delete a Worksheet: Delete a worksheet by right-clicking its tab and clicking Delete. Deleting a worksheet is permanent, so always make sure there is no important data in the worksheet before you delete it.
    4. Rename a Worksheet: Rename a worksheet by right-clicking its tab and clicking Rename.
    5. Duplicate a Worksheet: Duplicate a worksheet by right-clicking its tab and clicking Move or Copy. In the dialog box that appears, select the Create a Copy check box, choose the location where you want the copy to appear, and click OK.
    6. Tab Color: Worksheet tabs can be color-coded by right-clicking and clicking Tab Color, then selecting a color. In Image 1, the February worksheet has a tab color applied to it.
    </pre>
    <pre>Workbook Management <br>
1. Workbook: An Excel workbook is a collection of one or more worksheets. Simply put, each Excel file is a workbook. The name of the workbook pictured in Image 2 is Book1.
2. New: On the New tab, you can create a new, blank workbook or use an existing template.
3. Open: Click the Open tab to open an existing workbook on your computer.
4. Save/Save As: The Save and Save As tabs are used to save an existing workbook. By default, Excel saves an .xlsx file. PDF and CSV are two other useful formats you can save as. 
    A PDF file will retain all of the formatting of the original document and can be accessed on any computer, but further edits are difficult to make. 
    A CSV (comma-separated values) file can be opened and edited using any spreadsheet program, so this format is useful for collaboration with users without Excel.
5. Print: The Print tab is where you can print a workbook. This tab contains the print settings, including page orientation and margin sizes, as well as the print preview, where you can see how your workbook will look while printed.
6. Blank Workbook: In the File tab, click New > Blank Workbook to create a new blank workbook.
    </pre>
    <pre>Data Import<br>
        1. From Access: From Access imports a table or query from an Access database.
        2. From Web: From Web opens a browser where you can search for data tables on the Internet to import. This is useful for importing bank statements, bills, and credit card transactions into Excel for analysis.
        3. From Text: From Text imports .txt files. This is especially useful when the file is delimited in a nonstandard way, such as with tabs or other special characters.
        4. From Other Sources: From Other Sources is used to import data from various formats and sources, such as from a SQL server or XML file.
    </pre>
    <h3>5.2.8 Workbook Management Tip</h3>
    <pre>
File Management: When saving and managing workbook files, consider the following recommendations:
-Use a hierarchical folder system that will allow you to find workbook files easily. To make file searches easier, add property information (File > Info).

-Take advantage of the default AutoRecover information, which is saved every 10 minutes. Use this feature to recover recent document changes or unsaved files when your computer shuts down or crashes while Excel is open. You can view the recovered documents by going to the Info tab in the Backstage view and clicking Manage Versions > Recover Unsaved Documents.

-Use the Track Changes feature (found on the Review tab) to log changes that you or other people make to workbook drafts.

Distributing Workbooks: When importing or distributing data, consider the following recommendations:
-When your workbook is complete, use the Mark as Final option to make the document read only, restricting any further edits. You can also restrict users from making specific types of changes. To mark a document as final, go to the Info tab in the Backstage view and click Protect Document > Mark as Final.

-For sensitive information, require a password to open the workbook. You can also use the Document Inspector to perform an inspection for sensitive information before distributing the workbook. You can access the Document Inspector in the Info tab of the Backstage view by clicking Check for Issues > Inspect Document.

Using Multiple Worksheets: To make using multiple worksheets easier, consider the following suggestions:
-When naming your worksheets, stick to a single naming convention. This makes it easier to know what information is on a sheet just by looking at its tab.

-Make your worksheets as uniform as possible. This is especially useful if you want to make a formula that pulls information from various sheets.

-If you plan to have several worksheets with similar data, create a template sheet that you can copy and use as many times as you need.

    <h2>5.3 Organizing and Entering Data</h2>
    relationship between rows and columns, copy and paste, delete row and column vs deleting data from row or column, undo and redo paste formatting, values, transposed, formula only, and formatting and formula
    <h3>5.3.3 Large Dat Sets</h3>
    freeze panes, hiding rows and columns
    <pre>
<h4>5.3.2 Basic Features for Entering Data</h4>

1. Undo or RedoYou can undo or redo almost any action in Excel. The Undo and Redo buttons are found on the Quick Access Toolbar. You can also use the keyboard shortcuts Ctrl + Z for Undo and Ctrl + Y for Redo.

2. CutThe Cut command moves the information from the selected cells to the new location after you paste it. You can use the Cut button on the Home tab in the Clipboard group, or you can use the keyboard shortcut Ctrl + X.

3. CopyThe Copy command copies information from the selected cells to the Clipboard. The information can then be pasted to other locations. You can use the Copy button on the Home tab in the Clipboard group, or you can use the keyboard shortcut Ctrl + C.

4. Paste OptionsThe Paste command is used to paste information from the Clipboard to the selected cell or cells of your worksheet. By default, pasting will fill the selected cells with the formulas and formatting of the source cells. However, there are other paste options available when you click the bottom half of the Paste button in the Clipboard group.
    --Paste Formatting gives the destination cells the same formatting as the copied cells.
    --Paste Values copies the values from the Clipboard without the formulas. Use this if you want to copy the result of one of Excel's calculations.
    --Transpose switches the rows and columns of the copied data.

5. Name BoxThe Name Box shows the coordinates of the currently selected cell. You can select any cell in a worksheet by typing its coordinates into this box and pressing Enter. This is useful when you are working with extremely large worksheets.

6. Row TitleThis is the title for a row of data. Rows are all of the cells of a worksheet in a horizontal line and are defined by numbers.

7. Selected CellThe Selected Cell is the one that is ready to receive input from the keyboard. Even if you have a range of cells selected, there will always be one cell that text will appear in when you type. This cell is identified by a dark green outline and can also be seen in the Name Box.

8. Column TitleThis is the title for a column of data. Columns are all of the cells of a worksheet in a vertical line and are defined by letters.

9. Worksheet TitleThis is the title for the worksheet. It was created by merging several cells together using the Merge & Center button in the Alignment group.
</pre>
    <pre><h4>5.3.3 Cell Insertion, Deletion, and Hiding Features</h4>
1. Insert CellsYou can use the Insert button in the Cells group to insert rows and columns. Click the arrow below the Insert button and click either Insert Sheet Rows or Insert Sheet Columns. Rows are inserted above the currently selected row; columns are inserted to the left of the currently selected column. Alternatively, you can right-click a row or column header and click Insert to insert a row or column.

2. Delete CellsRows or columns can be deleted by using the Delete button in the Cells group. To do this, select a cell in the row or column you want to delete. Then, click the arrow below the Delete button and click either Delete Sheet Rows or Delete Sheet Columns. Alternatively, you can right-click a row or column header and click Delete to delete a row or column.
    --It's important to understand that deleting cells is different than deleting cell contents. To delete cell contents, select the cell or cells and press Delete. This will remove the information and leave the empty cells behind. Deleting cells will completely remove the selected cells from the spreadsheet.

3. ClearClear opens a drop down with several options for clearing cell contents.
    -Clear All removes all information from a selection, leaving default-white cells behind.
    -Clear Formats removes all formatting from a selection, leaving the data intact.
    -Clear Contents removes the data from a selection, leaving the formatting intact.
    -Clear Comments removes all comments from a selection.
    -Clear Hyperlinks removes hyperlinks from a selection, leaving the data and formatting intact.
    
4. Hide Rows/ColumnsRows and Columns can be hidden from view. This is useful when you want to focus on only certain parts of your data or if you have formulas that don't need to be seen. To hide a row or column, right-click the row or column header and click Hide. To unhide a row or column, select the rows or columns on both sides of the hidden one. Then, right-click the row or column header and click Unhide.
</pre>
    <pre><h4>5.3.4 Freezing Panes</h4>
1. Freeze PanesThe Freeze Panes feature is useful when navigating worksheets that are too large to fit on your screen. When a row or column is frozen, it will remain visible no matter where you scroll on your worksheet. The Freeze Panes button will freeze all the rows and columns above and to the left of your current selection. For example, if you click Freeze Panes when cell C3 is selected, you will freeze rows 1 and 2 (above row 3) and columns A and B (to the left of column C). When you have frozen panes, this button turns into Unfreeze Panes, which unfreezes all rows and columns.

2. Freeze Top RowFreeze Top Row will automatically freeze the top row of a worksheet, regardless of which cell is selected.

3. Freeze First ColumnFreeze First Column will automatically freeze the first column of a worksheet, regardless of which cell is selected.
</pre>
    <pre>Data Entry: Using keyboard shortcuts and proper formatting can speed up data entry considerably.
    --Press the Tab key and Shift + Tab to move right and left one column.
    --Press Enter and Shift + Enter to move down and up one row.
    --Clearly label your rows and columns. This helps you know where certain data should be entered.

Clipboard: The Clipboard in Excel is a bit different from other Microsoft Office applications. 
    --Any data you have on the Clipboard will be surrounded by a marching ants border. If you see a border, you have information in the Clipboard.
    --Using the Cut command doesn't delete information from your spreadsheet until you paste that information somewhere else. This is different from most applications, where the Cut command immediately deletes the selected information.
    --You can remove the marching ants (and clear your Clipboard) by double clicking a cell in your spreadsheet.
</pre>
    <h2>5.4 Changing Properties and Printing Worksheets</h2>
    <h3>5.4.1 Data Protection</h3>protecting worksheets and unlocking some cells
    <br><pre>
1. Protect Sheet: Excel allows you to control what content others can modify in your worksheets, ensuring that your worksheets will continue to function as intended. To protect an individual worksheet, click Protect Sheet and then enter a password. By default, all cells within a worksheet are locked; however, the cells won't actually be locked until the worksheet is protected. Before protecting the worksheet, you'll need to unlock any cell that users should be allowed to edit.

2. Protect Workbook: If you want to protect all worksheets in your workbook from being edited, click Protect Workbook and then enter a password. But remember, all worksheet cells are locked by default. So if you forget to unlock any cells, you will need to unprotect the workbook by entering your password, and then unlock the cells. You can then protect the workbook again. Any time you protect a workbook, you can choose a new password.

3. Unlocked Cell: When you want to allow users to edit cells in a protected workbook, you need to unlock the desired cells. You can do this by right-clicking on the cell you want to unlock and clicking Format Cells, which opens the Format Cells dialog box. On the Protection tab, click to clear the Locked check box.
    </pre>
    <h3>5.4.2 Data Validation</h3>
    <pre>
1. Info & PropertiesThe properties of a workbook provide metadata—information that describes the document. This information includes the document title, author name, subject, and keywords that identify the contents of the file. To modify a document's properties, go to the Info tab of the Backstage view and click on the property you want to edit.

2. Printer SelectionYou may already be connected to more than one printer; for example, the printer you use at school and the printer you use at home. The default printer will be displayed by name under Printer, but you can easily select a non-default printer to use. To select a non-default printer, simply select the printer from the Printer drop-down list (you may need to add the printer to your computer's configuration first).

3. Sheet SelectionBy default, Excel will print only the active worksheet, which is usually the worksheet that is currently displayed in your workspace. But if needed, you can choose to print all worksheets in the workbook or even a particular selection of cells.

4. Paper SidesIf your printer supports double-sided printing, you have two options for how it can print: flipping the paper on the short edge or on the long edge. If your printer does not support double-sided printing, you can select the option to manually print on both sides, which requires you to manually flip and reload the paper into the printer.

5. Paper CollationBy default, Excel prints collated copies of your worksheet, which is usually the best choice. If you have a multiple-page worksheet that you are printing for six peers to review, the default collated option will keep each copy of the worksheet together, rather than printing page one six times, page two six times, page three six times, and so on.

6. Paper OrientationThere are two types of page orientation. Excel's default page orientation setting is Portrait, where the long edge of the paper is vertical, but worksheets can also be printed in Landscape orientation, where the long edge of the paper is horizontal. Page orientation settings can also be found on the Page Layout tab.

7. Paper SizeMost worksheets can be printed on the standard 8.5" x 11" paper size. However, large data sets may call for other options, such as the 8.5" x 14" legal size.

8. Margin SettingsA margin is the amount of space between the text and the edge of the paper. Excel's default margin style is Normal, which leaves a 0.7 inch space between the text and each edge of the paper. You can customize the margin style on the Page Layout tab by clicking Margins.

9. Scaling OptionsDepending on how much data your worksheet contains, you may choose to scale the content to fit on one page. You can also choose to shrink the printout so none of the rows extend beyond one page high or so none of the columns extend beyond one page wide.
</pre>
    <h3>5.4.3 Excel Printing Tips</h3>
    <pre>
1. Print AreaBecause many worksheets contain a large amount of data, Excel allows you to define a print area, which is the selection of cells that you wish to print. When printing a worksheet, you can choose to ignore the print area. To clear the print area, click Print Area > Clear Print Area.
        
2. Print TitlesThe Print Titles button opens a dialog box where you can specify which rows or columns you would like repeated on each page.
</pre>
    <pre>
Protecting Worksheets: When protecting workbooks and worksheets, consider the following:
   --If you don't enter a password when you protect a worksheet, any user can remove the protection by clicking Unprotect Sheet.
   --Use a password you won't forget. There is no way to recover a lost password, so if you forget it, you'll never be able to make changes to your worksheet.
   --By default, protecting a worksheet prevents all actions except for entering data into unlocked cells. You can customize user permissions in the Protect Sheet dialog box, which appears when you click Protect Sheet.

Printing Worksheets: Remember the following suggestions when printing worksheets:
    --Always format spreadsheets you intend to print. Separate rows and columns are nearly impossible to discern when spreadsheets are printed without formatting.
    --If you're using a black and white printer, format your spreadsheet without colors before printing to make sure the printed page is readable.
    --When printing a multiple page spreadsheet, include page numbers. Without numbered pages, knowing the correct page order can be difficult.
</pre>
    <h2>5.5 Formatting Cells</h2>
    <h3>5.5.1 Number Formats</h3> percents, dollars, decimals, phone #s and dates
    <pre>
1. Number FormatsIn the Number Format drop down, you can choose custom formatting for your numerical data. By default, numbers are formatted using the General style, but other number formats include Currency, Date, Fraction, and Percentage.

2. Increase DecimalThe Increase Decimal button increases the number of decimal places that display in the selected cell. This can be useful for when you need your calculations to be very precise.

3. Decrease DecimalThe Decrease Decimal button decreases the number of decimal places that display in the selected cell. This can make cells with numbers much easier to read.

4. Accounting Number
    FormatThe Accounting Number Format button automatically formats the selected cells as currency. By default, it uses the dollar sign ($), but other currencies can be chosen by using the drop-down arrow next to the button.

5. Percent StyleThe Percent Style button formats the selected cell as a percent.

6. Comma StyleThe Comma Style button shows or hides the thousands separator for the selected cells.
    </pre>
    <h3>5.5.2 Cell Formats</h3> merge and center cells, modify columns, wrap text and more
    <pre>
        1. FontAlso called typeface or font family, font refers to a character set that is designed with a particular appearance. Examples include Times New Roman, Arial, Courier New, and Palatino Linotype.
        
        2. Font SizeFonts can be set to a particular size through the font size drop-down list. They can also be increased or decreased incrementally using the  buttons to the right of the drop-down list. The unit of measurement used for font sizes is the point.
        
        3. Font StyleStyle usually refers to formatting, such as italic, bold, and bold italic. Regular font styles do not include additional formatting. To apply or remove a font style, simply select the text you wish to change and then click either the bold or italic button.
        
        4. BordersBorders can be added to a cell to help visually separate data. You can stylize borders in a number of ways, including changing border thickness, adding double borders, or removing borders on specific sides.
        
        5. Fill ColorBy default, cells have no fill color. You can add a fill color to a cell by clicking the drop-down arrow on the Fill Color button and clicking a color.
        
        6. Font ColorThe default font color for a cell is black. To apply a different color, select one from the drop-down color gallery.
        
        7. Format Cells
            -Dialog BoxMost font changes can be made directly from the ribbon. A few additional options are available on the Font tab in the Format Cells dialog box. These include more underlining options, double strikethrough, and Small Caps, which replaces the lowercase letters in a title with capital letters that are a smaller font size. 
       
        1. Vertical AlignmentThese three buttons determine the vertical alignment of text within a cell. While this doesn't matter much when working with the default font size and row height, their use becomes apparent when you increase the height of a row.
        
        2. Text OrientationThe Text Orientation is used to choose the direction of text within a cell. By default, text is horizontal, but it can also be oriented vertically or at an angle. This is useful for when you have a long column title but want to maintain a specific column width.
        
        3. Wrap TextBy default, text typed into a single cell will continue on the same line. However, if Wrap Text is enabled, Excel will treat the edges of the cell like margins in Word, creating new lines as more text is added.
        
        4. Horizontal AlignmentThese three buttons determine the horizontal alignment of text within a cell. Because this formatting is applied to individual cells, it is common to see more than one option used in a workbook. For example, column titles are often centered, while information in the columns are right aligned.
        
        5. Decrease/Increase
                IndentThe Increase Indent button adds a space between the left margin of a cell and its text. Similarly, the Decrease Indent button removes this space. This feature can be useful when creating a tiered list.
        
        6. Merge OptionsSometimes you'll want to merge several cells into one cell; for example, when you want to put a title at the top of a column. Merge & Center merges all of the selected cells together and centers the information horizontally. By clicking the drop-down arrow next to Merge & Center, you can access more options. Merge Across will merge the selected cells horizontally but keep each row separate. Merge Cells merges the selected cells together without centering the content. Unmerge will divide a merged cell back into individual cells.
             
    </pre>
    <h3>5.5.3 Cell Styles and Colors</h3> use the cell styles group
    <pre>
1. Cell Styles GalleryCell Styles are preset formatting options that you can apply to one or more cells in your workbook. To apply a style, simply select the cell or cells and click the style you would like to apply. Styles are a great way to make your worksheets look better.

2. Clear FormatsThe Clear button will remove all of the formatting from the selected cells but will leave the content intact. This is useful when you want to reformat a spreadsheet without affecting the data.

3. Column Width ErrorWhen your cell shows ######, it means that the column is not wide enough to display the number. You can resolve this error by increasing the column width.

4. Row HeightRow Height opens the Row Height dialog box, where you can define the row height (in points).

5. Column WidthColumn Width opens the Column Width dialog box, where you can define the column width (in points).

6. AutoFitThe two AutoFit tools in the Format drop down adjust row height or column width to match the data in the selected cell.

    <h3>5.5.4 Cell Borders</h3> selecting and using Borders in the borders drop down menu
    <h3>5.5.5 </h3>
    <h3>5.5.8 Cell Formatting Tip</h3>
    <pre>
Fonts, Colors, and Borders:  When deciding on the fonts and colors to use for your spreadsheet, consider the following recommendations:
    --Use only one or two colors when formatting a spreadsheet.
    --Most of the time, leave your font color black. However, if you change the fill to a dark color, you may need to change the font to a lighter color.
    --To make data in tables easier to read, make each row an alternating color (also called banding).

Alignment:  Proper cell alignment can increase a document's readability.
    --The easiest way to make a good-looking title for your cells is to use the Merge and Center command.
    --Remember that data can be aligned both vertically and horizontally in your cells.

Number Formatting:  Numbers can be formatted in a variety of ways.
    --Even though dates don't look like numbers (especially when formatted), Excel recognizes them as numbers. This makes it easy to add and subtract days. For example, adding 3 to January 30 will generate the date February 2 rather than January 33.
    --Usually you'll only want to display decimal places when you need to see them. For money, consider displaying only two decimal places.
    --If you run into the ######## error, you should either enlarge the column or reduce the number of decimal places that are displayed.

Cell Formatting:  Below are some facts about resizing rows and columns:
    --The easiest way to resize a column to fit its data is to double click the right side of the column header.
    --If you want to resize multiple rows or columns, select the headings of the rows or columns you want to resize and make the changes.
    --Remember that when you resize a row or column, you must resize all cells in that row or column. Plan your spreadsheet accordingly.

    <h2>5.6 Entering Functions</h2> using math operators, built-in functions, AutoSum tool
    <br> Excel formulas start with '=' equal sign, refernce other cells by ex: =A1
    <br><br><b>=NAME(arg1, arg2, arg3)</b>
    <br>Formula Tab has built-in formulas
    <h3>5.6.2 AutoFill Options</h3>
    month of the years can be "AutoFilled", so can days, there is an "AutoFill" option menu by the cursor in the program (drop down menu).
    <br> autofill for copying formulas over from other cells, ex: dragging and autofilling the 'total' to other columns in the example on the video
    <h3>5.6.3 Add and Average</h3>
    autosum works best for data directly above it (use it at the bottom of a column)
    <br><b>=SUM(B2:B23)</b> in the example will add the data in column b from cell2 : cell23 (don't use - otherwise it will subtract. use : )
    <br><br>Average is found using: <b>=AVERAGE(B2:B23)</b> would average the total of those numbers
    <pre>
1. AutoSum: When you click the AutoSum, Excel will guess which numbers you want to add and then insert the SUM function into the selected cell. 
        Even though AutoSum is pretty good at guessing, you should always double-check the generated function before pressing Enter. The drop-down arrow on the AutoSum button opens a list of other functions (discussed below) that can be automatically inserted.
2. AVERAGE: AVERAGE finds the arithmetic mean of a range of cells.
3. COUNT
    Function: COUNT counts the numbers in a range of cells. Count Numbers does not count text or blank cells.
4. MAX and MIN
    Functions: MAX and MIN return the highest or lowest number in a range of cells, respectively. This is useful when summarizing very large amounts of data.
5. Insert Function
    Dialog Box: More Functions opens the Insert Function dialog box, where you can search for and insert any function. This is especially useful if you are unfamiliar with functions. 
        This dialog box can also be opened by clicking the Insert Function button next to the formula bar, as long as you don't have an active formula selected.
    </pre>
    <h3>5.6.4 Text Functions</h3>
    <b>=LEFT(A2, 3)</b> will return the 3 left most items from the A2 cell (ex: 3 letter abbreviations for month or day)
    <br><b>=RIGHT(A2, 4)</b> will return the 4 right most items from the A2 cell (good for social security # - last 4 digits)
    <br><b>=MID(A2, 2, 100)</b> will start on the 2nd character of the A2 cell and display information from character 2 : character 100
    <br><br><b>=UPPER(A2)</b> display all information from cell A2 as Upper Case
    <br><b>=LOWER(A2)</b> display information Lower Case
    <br><br><b>=PROPER(A2)</b> The first character will be capitalized (useful for working with names)
    <pre>
1. CONCAT: CONCAT takes multiple inputs and concatenates them into a single string. It can accept as arguments text, references to cells, and references to ranges.
2. TEXTJOIN: TEXTJOIN concatenates multiple items using a delimiter, such as a comma, space, or period. The first argument defines the delimiter. The second argument determines whether the function will ignore blank cells. The remaining arguments are the items to be concatenated.
3. LEFT and RIGHT: LEFT and RIGHT return a specified number of characters from the left or right of a text string. The first argument determines the number of characters, and the second argument supplies the text.
4. MID: MID returns characters from the middle of a text string, given a starting position and length. The first argument specifies the text. The second argument is a number that determines which character is the first in the returned string, and the third argument is a number that determines how many characters the function will return.
5. UPPER and LOWER: UPPER and LOWER reformat text to all upper or lower case letters.
6. LEN: LEN returns the number of characters in a text string.
7. PROPER: PROPER reformats text to make the first letter of each word upper case and all other letters lower case.

    <h3>5.6.5 Concatenating in Excel</h3> combine items for multiple cells
    <br>ex: first and last names <b>=CONCAT(A2," ",B2)</b>
    <br><b>=CONCAT(B2,", ",A2)</b> would do last name first
    <br><b>&</b> is shorthand =Concat; ex: <b>=B4&" "&A4</b>
    <br><br>TEXTJOIN(" ",1,A2:D2) -- with text join the 1 in that parameter denotes that we will ignore_empty spaces
    <h3>5.6.6 Formula Facts</h3> Flash Fill, COUNTA and COUNTBLANK = counts nonblank or blank cells, =LEN - finds Length

1. Functions List: Most of the time, this box is called the Name Box. However, when you begin typing a formula in a cell (by typing =), it changes into a list of common or recently used functions. This can be helpful when making formulas that require multiple functions.
2. Cancel/Enter: The Cancel and Enter buttons perform the same action as pressing Esc or Enter on your keyboard, respectively. When entering a formula, it is important that you either click the Enter button or press Enter on your keyboard when you're done. If you don't, 
    Excel will think that you're still working on your formula when, in fact, you're trying to do something else. If you ever mess up a formula and want to start over, press Esc.
3. Function Arguments
    Dialog Box: When you have an active formula, clicking this button opens the Function Arguments dialog box. An argument is a number or cell that Excel uses in calculating the formula. This dialog box is especially useful when entering complicated functions with multiple arguments. 
        If you don't have an active formula, this button opens the Insert Function dialog box (see below).
4. Formula Bar: The Formula Bar shows the underlying formulas of the selected cell. In Image 1, if the selected cell were C16 the formula bar would display =SUM(C4:C16). Formulas and other information can be typed directly into the formula bar, which is useful when creating long or complex formulas.
5. Active Formula: An active formula is a formula that is currently being typed into a cell. In the example above, the active formula is in cell B16. You can tell that it's an active formula because the formula itself is in the cell, not the result. Inactive formulas (such as cell C16) display 
    the result of the formula. The blue outline around cells B4 through B15 shows that those cells are part of the active formula.

    <h3>5.6.9 Forumula Tips</h3>
    <pre>
Formula Entry:  When entering formulas, consider the following:
    -Whenever you type parentheses into a formula, each opening parenthesis and its corresponding closing parenthesis are color coded with the same color. This helps you to keep track of where they are.
    -Any cells you reference in your formula are also color coded. Both the cell coordinates in the formula and the cell itself are highlighted the same color.
    -If you make a mistake when entering a formula, the easiest way to fix it is usually to delete the entire formula and start over.
    -Text functions can be applied to numerical data. However, this will store the numerical data as a text value, which may cause problems when using the data in calculations.

AutoSum:  Simple functions can be added to a spreadsheet with the AutoSum button.
    -The AutoSum button is often the fastest way to add simple functions to your spreadsheet. The functions it provides are SUM, AVERAGE, COUNT NUMBERS, MAX, and MIN.
    -Make sure to select the cell where you want the formula to appear before you click the AutoSum button.
    -AutoSum will make its best guess as to what information you want to use for your calculation, but it isn't always perfect. You can fix this by clicking the function you want to use, selecting the data to use, and pressing Enter.
