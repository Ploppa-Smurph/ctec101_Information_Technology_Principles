    <pre>
    System Software
    An operating system is the most common example of system software. Three other types are utility software, device drivers, and firmware. The table below takes a short look at each one.
    Table 1: System Software
    Term 	Description
    Utility Software 	Utility software analyzes, configures, and optimizes the computer. Unlike application software, which benefits the end user directly, utility software is used to support and maintain the computer system. Some common types of utility software include:
    
        Backup software creates backup copies of data and restores them if the original data is lost or corrupted
        Compression software compresses and decompresses files, making storage more efficient
        Disk cleaners delete temporary or unnecessary information from disk drives
        Antivirus software prevents viruses and other malware from harming the computer system
    
    Device Drivers 	A device driver is software that helps an operating system communicate with hardware devices, such as printers, video cards, scanners, and cameras. Instead of an operating system, such as Windows, having instructions for every hardware device that can be attached, users install the driver for the specific hardware. The driver translates signals from the operating system into instructions the hardware can understand.
    
    In many cases, some device drivers can be installed by Windows using plug-and-play technology. This means that when you plug in a device, such as a USB disk, Windows automatically locates and installs the correct device driver for you.
    
    In other cases, the driver must be manually installed. In Windows, this is most often accomplished using the Device Manager. In Windows 10 (version 1803 and newer), Device Manager can be accessed by right-clicking Start and selecting Device Manager from the list shown.
    
    When you have to uninstall a driver, Device Manager is useful to verify that a driver was fully removed. In Windows 10 (version 1803 and newer), you can also manage device drivers by right-clicking Start and going to Settings > Devices.
    
    With Linux-based systems, you may find some GUI interfaces for installing device drivers, but many times you must download, compile, and install drivers manually.
    Firmware 	Firmware is read-only software preinstalled on a device that tells the device how to work. In many ways, it's like a low-level operating system. Firmware can be found in televisions, remote controls, game consoles, printers, cameras, music players, and even automobiles. Sometimes, manufacturers release firmware updates that fix bugs and add new features.
    Common Windows Utilities
    The table below describes a few of the most commonly used Windows utilities.
    Table 2: Common Windows Utilities
    Program 	Description
    Windows Settings 	The Windows Settings App customizes how the computer looks and functions. The Settings App lets you make most configuration changes that used to be done in the Control Panel (if you're familiar with older versions of Windows).
    
    To launch the Settings App, click the Start button and select Settings. Within the app are several options you can use to configure system settings such as security, power plans, network connections, installed applications, accessibility settings, and display settings.
    File Explorer 	File Explorer (formerly known as Windows Explorer) is a file management application that comes with Windows. File Explorer's main purpose is to let you view, open, copy, move, and otherwise manage your files and folders.
    Task Manager 	Task Manager is a process management administration utility that comes with Microsoft Windows. It lets users perform tasks such as shut down applications that are not responding; view processes and applications that are using system resources; view network usage; and disconnect users from the system.
    
    One of the most common things you'll do with Task Manager is to end an unresponsive app. To perform this task, take the following steps:
    
        Press Ctrl + Alt + Delete and select Task Manager
        Select the Processes tab.
        Select the unresponsive app or process from the list.
        Select End task
    
    Device Manager 	Device Manager is a Windows utility that lets you view and control peripheral devices and other hardware components. You can use Device Manager to troubleshoot hardware issues, update drivers, and view the technical properties of hardware devices.

    <h3>4.3.5 Boot Process</h3>
    <pre>
    The Boot Process
The following graphic shows what happens when you turn on (also known as boot) a computer. The process is similar for almost all types of computers, including desktops, laptops, phones, and gaming consoles.
The Boot Process
The boot process flowchart.
The following steps describe the six tasks involved in the boot process.
Step 1: Activate the BIOS
Whenever you turn a computer turn on, electricity flows from a power source (such as a wall outlet or battery) into the motherboard. The power activates the basic input/output system (BIOS). A BIOS is a simple program that's written directly into the motherboard's hardware.
Step 2: Check the CMOS
The first thing the BIOS does is look at the complementary metal-oxide-semiconductor (CMOS) chip. The CMOS contains the BIOS settings (instructions) for exactly how each hardware device on the computer should be initialized.
Step 3: Initialize Hardware
The BIOS then initializes (wakes up) each piece of hardware according to the instructions it finds in the CMOS. This includes fans, memory, hard drives, and processors.
Step 4: POST
Once everything's been initialized, the BIOS runs a program called power-on self-test (POST). The BIOS checks each hardware device and verifies that it's working properly.
On many computers, the BIOS reports the results of POST with a beep code. A single beep means everything's fine. If there's a problem, it plays a combination of beeps. The user can then refer to the motherboard's documentation to interpret the beep code and find out what the problem is.
Step 5: Find an Operating System
Once POST is done, the BIOS looks for a bootable device or a storage drive that contains an operating system. It does this according to a predetermined boot order, which is stored on the CMOS.
On a typical desktop computer, the first drive in the boot order is the optical drive. If there isn't a disc with an operating system in the tray, the BIOS will check the next drive in the boot order.
Step 6: Load the OS into RAM
Once the BIOS finds an operating system, it loads it into the computer's RAM. From there, the processor starts executing the instructions and the OS takes over. At this point, the job of the BIOS is finished and it becomes dormant.
