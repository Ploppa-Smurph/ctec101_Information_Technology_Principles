    <h1>CTEC-101 Week 05 Chapter 04 - Additional Computer Software</h1>
    <pre>
    System Software
    An operating system is the most common example of system software. Three other types are utility software, device drivers, and firmware. The table below takes a short look at each one.
    Table 1: System Software
    Term 	Description
    Utility Software 	Utility software analyzes, configures, and optimizes the computer. Unlike application software, which benefits the end user directly, utility software is used to support and maintain the computer system. Some common types of utility software include:
    
        Backup software creates backup copies of data and restores them if the original data is lost or corrupted
        Compression software compresses and decompresses files, making storage more efficient
        Disk cleaners delete temporary or unnecessary information from disk drives
        Antivirus software prevents viruses and other malware from harming the computer system
    
    Device Drivers 	A device driver is software that helps an operating system communicate with hardware devices, such as printers, video cards, scanners, and cameras. Instead of an operating system, such as Windows, having instructions for every hardware device that can be attached, users install the driver for the specific hardware. The driver translates signals from the operating system into instructions the hardware can understand.
    
    In many cases, some device drivers can be installed by Windows using plug-and-play technology. This means that when you plug in a device, such as a USB disk, Windows automatically locates and installs the correct device driver for you.
    
    In other cases, the driver must be manually installed. In Windows, this is most often accomplished using the Device Manager. In Windows 10 (version 1803 and newer), Device Manager can be accessed by right-clicking Start and selecting Device Manager from the list shown.
    
    When you have to uninstall a driver, Device Manager is useful to verify that a driver was fully removed. In Windows 10 (version 1803 and newer), you can also manage device drivers by right-clicking Start and going to Settings > Devices.
    
    With Linux-based systems, you may find some GUI interfaces for installing device drivers, but many times you must download, compile, and install drivers manually.
    
    Firmware 	Firmware is read-only software preinstalled on a device that tells the device how to work. In many ways, it's like a low-level operating system. Firmware can be found in televisions, remote controls, game consoles, printers, cameras, music players, and even automobiles. Sometimes, manufacturers release firmware updates that fix bugs and add new features.
    
    Common Windows Utilities
    Windows Settings 	The Windows Settings App customizes how the computer looks and functions. The Settings App lets you make most configuration changes that used to be done in the Control Panel (if you're familiar with older versions of Windows).
    To launch the Settings App, click the Start button and select Settings. Within the app are several options you can use to configure system settings such as security, power plans, network connections, installed applications, accessibility settings, and display settings.
 
    File Explorer 	File Explorer (formerly known as Windows Explorer) is a file management application that comes with Windows. File Explorer's main purpose is to let you view, open, copy, move, and otherwise manage your files and folders.
 
    Task Manager 	Task Manager is a process management administration utility that comes with Microsoft Windows. It lets users perform tasks such as shut down applications that are not responding; view processes and applications that are using system resources; view network usage; and disconnect users from the system.
     One of the most common things you'll do with Task Manager is to end an unresponsive app. To perform this task, take the following steps:
    
        Press Ctrl + Alt + Delete and select Task Manager
        Select the Processes tab.
        Select the unresponsive app or process from the list.
        Select End task
    
    Device Manager 	Device Manager is a Windows utility that lets you view and control peripheral devices and other hardware components. You can use Device Manager to troubleshoot hardware issues, update drivers, and view the technical properties of hardware devices.

    <h3>4.3.5 Boot Process</h3>
    <pre>
    The Boot Process
The following graphic shows what happens when you turn on (also known as boot) a computer. The process is similar for almost all types of computers, including desktops, laptops, phones, and gaming consoles.
The Boot Process

The following steps describe the six tasks involved in the boot process.

Step 1: Activate the BIOS
Whenever you turn a computer turn on, electricity flows from a power source (such as a wall outlet or battery) into the motherboard. The power activates the basic input/output system (BIOS). A BIOS is a simple program that's written directly into the motherboard's hardware.

Step 2: Check the CMOS
The first thing the BIOS does is look at the complementary metal-oxide-semiconductor (CMOS) chip. The CMOS contains the BIOS settings (instructions) for exactly how each hardware device on the computer should be initialized.

Step 3: Initialize Hardware
The BIOS then initializes (wakes up) each piece of hardware according to the instructions it finds in the CMOS. This includes fans, memory, hard drives, and processors.

Step 4: POST
Once everything's been initialized, the BIOS runs a program called power-on self-test (POST). The BIOS checks each hardware device and verifies that it's working properly.
On many computers, the BIOS reports the results of POST with a beep code. A single beep means everything's fine. If there's a problem, it plays a combination of beeps. The user can then refer to the motherboard's documentation to interpret the beep code and find out what the problem is.

Step 5: Find an Operating System
Once POST is done, the BIOS looks for a bootable device or a storage drive that contains an operating system. It does this according to a predetermined boot order, which is stored on the CMOS.
On a typical desktop computer, the first drive in the boot order is the optical drive. If there isn't a disc with an operating system in the tray, the BIOS will check the next drive in the boot order.

Step 6: Load the OS into RAM
Once the BIOS finds an operating system, it loads it into the computer's RAM. From there, the processor starts executing the instructions and the OS takes over. At this point, the job of the BIOS is finished and it becomes dormant.

    Clearing CMOS and Resetting BIOS Settings
        
    First method	
    1.To reset the CMOS and return everything to factory defaults:
    2.Boot your computer. While the computer is booting, do step 2.
    3.Press the indicated key to enter the BIOS settings page.
    4.Choose BIOS Setup Utility.
    5.Navigate to Reset BIOS Settings (wording may vary by manufacturer). It's usually found near the bottom of the options.
    6.Save the settings.
    7.Restart the computer.
    
    Second method
    1.To reset the BIOS by resetting the CMOS battery:
    2.Unplug the computer. If using a laptop, remove the main battery.
    3.Open the computer case. If you're using a laptop find the CMOS battery panel and open it.
    4.Remove the CMOS battery.
    5.Let the CMOS battery sit out for a few minutes.
    6.Return the CMOS battery to its original place.
    7.Replace any main batteries if the computer is a laptop.
    8.Plug in the computer.
    9.Verify the settings are reset.
    
    Third Method	If you're trying to reset a desktop computer, you may be able to use the CLEAR CMOS jumper if the motherboard one. Follow theses steps:
    1.Unplug the computer
    2.Open the computer case. The jumper is located on the motherboard and should have a label that says CLEAR CMOS or something similar. The jumper may be on a two-pin or three-pin setup.
    3.If it's on a two-pin setup, remove the jumper completely.
    4.If it's on a three-pin setup, move the jumper over from the two pins it's on and onto the other pins. The center pin will remain the same.
    5.Close the case and plug in your computer.
    6.Reboot to see if the settings have been reset.
    If you've been successful, repeat the process and return the jumper to its original position. If you don't, the CMOS will be cleared every time you boot the computer.

</pre>
    <h3>Productivity Software</h3>
    ie: Microsoft App
    <pre>
Office Application Suites -	Microsoft Office, including Word, Excel, and PowerPoint, is the most widely-used office productivity software. Other popular suites include OpenOffice and LibreOffice, which are free open source solutions, and Google’s G-Suite, which is a paid service. One of the reasons people like to use an integrated office application suite is that they have a common user interface and make it easy to share data between applications.

Word Processing	- Word processors store, manipulate, and format text. Most of the things we read, like books, newspapers, and web articles, were first written in a word processor.

Spreadsheets -	A spreadsheet is an application where data is organized into rows and columns. They can be used to store and organize information, as well as perform complex calculations. Spreadsheets can also create charts and graphs, which are useful for making sense of data.

Presentations -	Slideshow presentations are most commonly used as a visual supplement for a verbal presentation. They help highlight the speaker's most important points and illustrate difficult concepts. They're also a great way to share visual media, such as pictures and videos, with a large audience.

Web Browsers -	When web browsers are used for online research and for building relationships with business customers, they are also considered productivity software. The most popular browsers include Google Chrome, Mozilla Firefox, and Apple Safari. Most web browsers are free to download and install on a computer.

Visual Diagramming -	Visual diagramming tools help create flowcharts and other graphical representations of ideas. Most word processing and presentation software includes built-in visual diagramming tools. For more shapes and diagram templates, you can use a dedicated visual diagramming tool such as Microsoft Visio or Google Drawings.

Cloud-Based Options -	Cloud-based productivity software such as Google’s G-Suite and Microsoft Office Online run inside a web browser. These web applications allow online collaborative editing. This means multiple users can work on the same document, presentation, or spreadsheet at the same time.
</pre>
    <h3>Collaboration Software</h3> - discussion boards, screen sharing, webinars, email, group calendar, instant messaging (done on computers normally), texting is sms (through phone service)
    <pre>
Message boards	- or discussion forums are online sites where people can hold discussions on various topics by posting messages. Topics can vary greatly from how to fix a computer to the latest news on your favorite TV show.
                    Conversations happen in threads, where one person posts a message or question, then other users respond to it. Since discussions on these boards are done asynchronously, they're also a great way to brainstorm ideas without having to set up a meeting.
Screen sharing	 -Screen sharing allows a user's screen to be viewed by one or more people. This feature can be used by a support person to view the screen of a user who needs help. Or, several users can view a trainer's screen while a technique is demonstrated. Applications that allow screen sharing include:
                Skype
                Chrome Remote Desktop
                HipChat
Conferencing software - 	Webinars and other conferencing software allow you to connect with people through video, voice, and chat. Also known as web casts or web conferencing, webinars may be used for meetings, lectures, presentations, or training events that need to reach large audiences at remote locations.

Email -	Although there has been a rise in various forms of digital communication, email remains the most popular. Short for electronic mail, email is much like sending a letter or note through the post, except that it's delivered electronically.
        Email software allows you to write a message, add the recipient's email address, and click send. In addition to its speed, email has other benefits over traditional mail such as the ability to attach files and send a single message to many recipients.
            There are two types of email systems: webmail and desktop clients. Webmail, such as Gmail and Yahoo! mail, are accessed through a web browser. Email clients, such as Microsoft Outlook, run as separate applications on a computer.
            Microsoft Outlook  is an example of a personal information manager (PIM). It can help clients manage contacts, calendar items, and reminders, as well as email.            
            
Calendaring	Online calendars are an excellent way to coordinate the schedules of each member on a team. Usually, everyone on the team has an individual calendar to mark when they are busy or available.
            It's an easy to see when everyone is available to have a meeting or when a team member should be left alone.

Instant messaging (IM)	- Instant messaging is exactly what its names implies: a way to send messages that are instantly presented to the recipient. Most conversations on instant messaging happen in real time and can include two or more people.
        The communication is instant because both recipients are logged onto the same IM server using the same client software. Instant messaging is a popular form of social interaction, as well as a useful tool in the business world. Examples of instant messaging services are:
            WhatsApp
            Google Hangouts
            Facebook Messenger
            Slack
            Skype
    Instant messaging software can also include the ability to have voice calls or video calls. In case of voice calls, the audio sounds are sent as data packets over the network eliminating the need for standard telephone lines. This ability to make voice calls over the internet is called Voice over IP, or VoIP.
    Video communication through IM apps works in the same way. To have real-time conversations without latency issues (delays in delivery of sound or video), it is important to have reliable internet service with enough bandwidth for the application to function without delays.

Text messaging -	Text messaging, sometimes called Short Messaging Service (SMS) or texting, is similar to instant messaging because communication is done through short messages. The main difference is that text messaging is handled through a phone service; instant messaging uses the internet.
                Generally, texting is done on cell phones. A similar service, Multimedia Message Service (MMS) allows pictures and videos to be sent in text messages.
                
Online workspace & document sharing	Cloud-based solutions provide an online workspace for people to collaborate more effectively. Online workspaces are a great way to share documents, spreadsheets, presentations, or other files. Online workspaces allow you to track revisions and provide feedback.
        Because documents are stored and accessed online, they can support collaborative editing, where multiple users work simultaneously on a document. Examples of cloud-based solutions services include:
            Microsoft Office 365
            G-Suite by Google

Video teleconferencing	- As technology has developed, it has become more and more common to have meetings, conferences, interviews, and one-on-one communications through video conferencing.
        There are three basic categories of video teleconferencing: room-based video conferencing, telepresence, and desktop videoconferencing. All of these include the interaction of at least two users through high-quality video and audio over an IP network.
        Room-based video conferencing is generally based on hardware that is placed and configured in a room designed for meetings. It requires compatibility with the video conferencing system on the other end of the connection.
        Telepresence is transmitting your presence to a remote location such as a boardroom. Telepresence generally involves several people from remote locations virtually attending a meeting using HD or 4K resolution technologies (even virtual reality headsets) to give the feeling of meeting together in person.
        Desktop video conferencing is video teleconferencing in which the software and hardware needed for the communication are in a desktop computer. This technology allows for last minute meetings and communications.

Remote Desktop - 	There are times when you would like to access a computer remotely, maybe you are working from home and need to access your desktop at the office, or maybe you need to help someone at another location with their IT issue.
                Remote Desktop is software that allows you to use a remote computer as if it were sitting in front of you.
                Remote desktop software also allows for screen sharing. It allows you to display your screen for others to view remotely without the ability for them to interact with it or control any part of it.
