    <h3>6.1.3 Overview</h3>
    <pre>
    Creating and Managing Presentations-- When making a PowerPoint presentation, you can either create a new presentation from scratch, or you can use a pre-designed template from PowerPoint's extensive template library. PowerPoint also provides numerous style presets that help you fine-tune your presentation to fit any subject or situation.
    
    Formatting Text within Placeholders-- PowerPoint uses placeholders to hold and format text. Placeholders can be moved anywhere on a slide and can be resized, rotated, and formatted in a variety of ways. The text contained within a placeholder can be stylized in much the same way as other Microsoft Office products.
    
    Slide Design--  In addition to a vast template library, PowerPoint provides you with several tools and features that will help you customize any presentation to fit your specific needs. You can even easily design a presentation from scratch by using PowerPoint's built-in style tools.
    
    The Slide Master--  By using the Slider Master view, you can quickly make layout changes to all the slides in your presentation at once. You can also make layout changes to a particular subset of slides. This is extremely helpful when your presentation has a large number of slides.
    
    Formatting SmartArt and Other Illustrations-- Similar to Word, PowerPoint allows you to insert all types of illustrations, including shapes and charts. You can also insert SmartArt graphics, which can be used to communicate different types of information, such as processes, relationships, and hierarchies. Illustrations can be formatted to fit into your presentation.
    
    Formatting Tables and Charts-- PowerPoint tables and charts help you organize information into a more readable and visually compelling format.
    
    Formatting Pictures and Media-- After inserting a picture, video, or other media element into your presentation, you can adjust its look by using an array of visual effects and formatting tools.
    
    Applying Animations-- Animations can help your audience pay close attention to particular ideas or graphical elements in your presentation. There are a variety of animation effects to choose from, ranging from simply appearing on the screen at a certain time to moving across the screen in a specified pattern.
    
    Applying Transitions-- Transitions between slides can vary from subtle fades to more dynamic effects, such as curtains, checkerboards, and even origami folds.
    
    Delivering Presentations-- After designing and entering the content for a presentation, the next step is to deliver your presentation to an audience, whether in person or online. To deliver a powerful presentation, use PowerPoint's Presenter View, which provides you with your personal notes for each slide, a timer, a laser pointer tool, a preview of the upcoming slide, a slide zoom option, and a blackout option.
    
    Printing Presentations and Handouts-- PowerPoint provides some unique print layout options, including printing full page slides, content outlines, notes pages for the presenter, and even handouts for the audience.

    File Tab Features
    <pre>
1. New:  To create a new presentation, click the New tab. You can create a new presentation using either a blank presentation or one of the pre-designed templates that best suits your needs.
2. Open:  On the Open tab, you can open a recently saved presentation, or you can browse your computer to find and open a previously saved presentation.
3. Save/Save As:  PowerPoint presentations can be saved as a number of different file types. Most of the time you will save a presentation as the default .pptx file. However, sometimes you might need to save your presentation in a different format. The Save As tab allows you to select a file type to save as from the Save as Type drop down. You can save your presentation as a PDF; an image, such as a JPG or PNG; and even a video. You can either save your files on your local machine, or if you have a OneDrive account you can save your flies to Microsoft's cloud storage service.
4. Properties:  The properties of a presentation provide metadataâ€”information that describes the document. This information includes the presentation title, author name, tags, categories, and slide numbers, all of which identify the contents of the file. To modify a document's properties, go to the Info tab of the Backstage view and click on the property you want to edit.
</pre>
    <pre>
1. Paste Options:  When you copy content to the Clipboard, you can paste it elsewhere in your presentation by clicking the Paste button or using the keyboard shortcut Ctrl + V. Most of the time, text will bring its formatting (font size, font styles, and links) with it when it's pasted. To insert content from the Clipboard without any previous formatting, paste it as usual, and then click Paste Options, which will appear next to the pasted text. Click Keep Text Only. Paste Options can also be found by clicking the drop-down arrow below the Paste button in the Clipboard group.

2. Slides Tab:  The Slides tab displays a thumbnail of each slide in your presentation. This tab makes it easy to scroll quickly through your presentation and edit a particular slide.

3. Duplicate Slide:  To duplicate a slide, right-click the slide and click Duplicate Slide. The duplicate slide will be inserted below the original slide.

4. Delete Slide:  If you are certain that you do not need the content of a slide, right-click the slide and click Delete Slide. If there is a possibility that you may need the content later, consider hiding the slide instead.

5. Cut:  Slides themselves, or slide elements (such as text, graphics, and placeholders), can be deleted and moved to the Clipboard using the Cut command. The content can then be pasted somewhere else in the presentation, or even into another presentation. When you use the Cut command, the slide or slide element is deleted from its original place in the presentation. To use the Cut command, click the Cut button or use the keyboard shortcut Ctrl + X.

6. Undo or Redo:  To undo or redo an action in PowerPoint without having to delete or retype anything, use the Undo and Redo buttons in the Quick Access Toolbar.

7. Copy:  Almost all elements in PowerPoint can be copied. To copy something, either click the Copy button or use the keyboard shortcut Ctrl + C.

8. Create New Slide:  Every PowerPoint presentation has at least one slide, but you will always need more than one slide for a presentation. You can create additional slides by clicking the New Slide button. Use the New Slide drop down to select a slide layout.

9. Add Section:  Longer presentations may need to be divided into sections. A section is a group of slides within a presentation. Sections can be expanded or collapsed in the Slides tab, which makes working with longer presentations much easier. To add a new section to a presentation, click the Section drop down and click Add Section.

10. Slide Pane:  The Slide Pane displays the currently selected slide and allows you to edit text and other slide elements.

11. Hide Slide:  You may have a presentation that is longer than the time you have available to present. Rather than deleting slides to shorten the presentation, you can simply hide unessential slides, preventing them from displaying during a presentation. To hide a slide, right-click the slide and click Hide Slide. To unhide a slide, right-click the slide and click Hide Slide again. A hidden slide has a faded thumbnail and a slash through its number.

    <h3>6.2.6 Presentation Tips</h3>
    <pre>
Opening and Saving:   When opening and saving multiple presentations:
        --If you need to open a presentation other than the one you're working on, go to the Open tab in the Backstage view and browse for the file you want to open. You do not need to exit PowerPoint to open a different presentation.
        --It's important to save your presentation often. However, if PowerPoint or your computer crashes, remember that PowerPoint's AutoRecover feature saves your work every ten minutes. An auto-saved version of your presentation can be recovered the next time you open PowerPoint.
        --When you first save a file, the file name will automatically be set as the text in the first paragraph of the first slide. While the default file name might be okay, it's important to clearly name your presentation in order to easily find it later.

Copying and Pasting Slides:  Oftentimes it's much easier to copy or duplicate a slide and modify the content instead of creating a blank slide.
        --If you are copying a slide from one presentation to another, you'll want to paste the slide using the destination theme.
        --In some cases, you may want to copy and paste a slide as a picture that can then be placed within another slide.
        --If your purpose is to delete a slide and move it somewhere else, make sure you use the Cut command so a copy of the slide isn't left behind.

Lengthy Presentations:  Longer presentations can sometimes be hard to manage, but there are a few things you can do to make dealing with long presentations easier.
        --When working with a lengthy presentation, grouping slides into sections will keep your Slide tab clean and make it easier to scroll through. You can add titles to your sections to help you easily identify them.
        --You may be giving the same presentation to more than one audience. If one group needs to hear only part of the presentation, and the other group needs to hear all of it, try hiding slides to give a shorter presentation instead of creating two separate presentations.

    <h3>6.3.4 Formatting Tips</h3>
    <pre>
        
        1. Font-  Also called typeface or font family, font refers to a character set that is designed with a particular appearance. Examples include: Times New Roman, Arial, Courier New, and Palatino Linotype.
        
        2. Font Style-  Style usually refers to formatting, such as italic, bold, and bold italic. Regular font styles do not include additional formatting. To apply or remove a font style, simply select the text you wish to change and then click either the bold or italic button.
        
        3. Font Effects-  In addition to font styles, other effects can be applied to fonts, including underlining, double-underlining, strikethrough, subscript (X0), and superscript (X2).
        
        4. Font Size-  Fonts can be set to a particular size through the font size drop-down list. They can also be increased or decreased incrementally using the  buttons to the right of the drop-down list. The unit of measurement used for font sizes is the point.
        
        5. Font Case-  Case is the typographical term that distinguishes lowercase letters from UPPERCASE letters. Word provides other standard capitalization schemes: Sentence case capitalizes only the first word of a sentence; Title Case capitalizes the principal words in names or titles.
        
        6. Font Color-  The default font color for documents is black. To apply a different color, select one from the drop-down color gallery.
        
        7. Clear All Formatting-  Clear All Formatting clears all formatting (such as paragraph spacing, underline, bold, italics, and superscript) from selected text and paragraphs, returning them to their default formatting.
        
        8. Text Placeholder-  A text placeholder is a box with a dotted border. While there are several different kinds of placeholdersâ€”including placeholders for tables, pictures, online pictures, and SmartArtâ€”text placeholders can hold only text. Apart from the Blank layout, default slide layouts already contain text placeholders. Click inside the placeholder to enter text or to edit existing text. To delete a placeholder, click the dotted border and press Backspace or Delete.  
    </pre>
    <pre>
    1. Bullets:  Bullet points draw attention to important information summarized as key points. Use the Bullets button to start a bulleted list. The default bullet style is a solid black circle. The Bullets drop-down gallery offers more bullet style options. If you want to use a bullet style that is not listed in the Bullet gallery, click Bullets and Numbering to create custom bullets. You can reformat existing paragraphs into a bulleted list by selecting the desired paragraphs and clicking the Bullets button.
        
    2. Numbering:  PowerPoint automatically begins a numbered list when you type 1 followed by a period or a close parenthesis, for example, 1. or 1), and then a space. You can also use the Numbering button and its drop-down gallery to manually create and format a numbered list. The Numbering drop-down gallery offers a variety of number formatting options. If the number format you need is not listed, click Bullets and Numbering to find more options. You can reformat existing paragraphs into a numbered list by selecting the desired paragraphs and clicking the Numbering button.
        
    3. Decrease/Increase
            Indent:  By default, lists in PowerPoint are not indented. However, you can change the indent of a list or paragraph by using the Decrease Indent and Increase Indent buttons. Below are the three types of indents that can be used:
                Left: The entire paragraph is indented a specified distance from the left of the page.
                First Line: Only the first line of the paragraph is indented.
                Hanging: All but the first line of the paragraph is indented a specified distance from the left of the page.
            Only left indents can be applied when using the Decrease Indent and Increase Indent buttons. Other indents are applied from the Paragraph dialog box.
        
    4. Line and Paragraph
            Spacing: Line spacing is the vertical distance between lines of text in a paragraph. Single- and double-spacing are the most common settings. However, there are other standard line spacing options, such as 1.25, and custom line spacing options, such as 1.80. Paragraph spacing is additional spacing before or after a paragraph.
        
    5. AlignmentParagraph alignment dictates how the body of the paragraph appears in relation to the left and right sides of a text box or placeholder. The default setting, Align Left, aligns content with the left side. Center aligns text with the center. Align Right aligns text with the right side. Justify aligns text with both the left and right sides.
        
    6. Align TextAs well as to the left, right, or horizontal center of the text box or placeholder, text can be aligned to the top, bottom, and vertical middle. 
    </pre> Text Insertion
    <pre>
1. Shapes:  Shapes are often used in PowerPoint presentations to point out or draw attention to specific information. For example, an arrow or star shape. Other types of shapes include callouts, flowcharts, and equation shapes. Enter text inside of a shape by right-clicking the shape and clicking Edit Text.

2. Text Box:  Use a text box to insert text anywhere on a slide without having to insert a placeholder. If the body of text being entered into a text box exceeds the dimensions of the box, the text box will automatically resize itself to fit the text.

3. Header & Footer:  The header and footer hold information placed at the top or bottom of a slide. For example, the date, author name, or slide number. Some header and footer content, such as date and page number, is formatted to automatically update if the presentation is opened at a later date or if additional slides are created.

4. Date & Time:  The date and time of the presentation's last edit can be added to the header or footer. The date and time can also be locked to display a specific day. In addition, the date and time can be set to update automatically by selecting the Update Automatically check box in the Date And Time dialog.

5. Slide Number:  The format and position of the slide number on each slide is determined by the layout of the chosen Slide Master.
</pre>
    <pre>
1. Text Box Margins:  Text box margins determine how far the text is spaced from the sides, top, and bottom of the text box. The smaller the margin, the more room for text.
2. Vertical Alignment:  Use the vertical alignment settings on the Text Options tab in the Format Shape pane or the Align Text drop down on the Home tab to align text vertically to the top, bottom, and middle of the page.
3. Autofit Settings:  Select one of the Autofit options to change how text interacts with the text box. Autofit options include Do not Autofit, Shrink text on overflow, and Resize shape to fit text.

    <h3>6.3.7 Formatting Tips</h3>
    <pre>
Style and Layout of Text:  Unless a presentation is image-based, the text is the most important element of each slide. When selecting the overall style and layout of text, remember the following:
    --The way your content is designed will have a profound effect on the interest of your audience, even if the information is otherwise boring or monotonous. However, don't rely solely on your designâ€”your content should still be well thought out.
    
    --Slides that contain a bulleted or numbered list are a lot easier to read than slides containing a block of content. Lists are great for things like character names, biographical facts, discussion points, and reading questions. Numbered lists in particular are useful for chronological points. Bullet points formatted as questions are a great way to generate group conversation.
    
    --Make sure to align placeholders with each other so the text looks uniform. Side-by-side placeholders look much better if they're aligned with their neighbors. The placeholders on preformatted layouts are already aligned, but you can move them if you need to.

Fonts:   When modifying fonts, keep in mind the following tips:
    --Selecting a legible font is extremely important. In general, stay away from decorative fonts unless you're only formatting one large word with few letters. Never use a decorative font if the presentation is intended for a professional setting. When in doubt, classic fonts (such as Times New Roman or Arial) are always a good choice.
    
    --In an academic paper, italics are sometimes okay to use, but bold, underlined, highlighted, and colored text are usually not. However, in a PowerPoint presentation you can use any of them in moderation.
    
    --Bold text can draw attention to a particular part of a slide. So can making the text a different color, putting a highlight behind it, and using italics. But be careful not to overuse font effects or color choices. Too many styles will detract from the content rather than add to it.

    <h2>6.4 Designing Slides</h2>
    <h3>Themes and Templates</h3> themes changes colors, fonts and layouts... templates offers even more pre customized options
    <h3>Slide Backgrounds</h3>
    <h3>6.4.3 Slide Design Facts</h3>
    <pre>
1. Presentation Themes-  PowerPoint themes are sets of design components that include background color and pattern, font styles, and placeholder layouts. Applying a theme to a presentation is a quick way to give it a polished look. Because a theme applies immediately to an entire presentation, the design process is significantly simplified. If needed, you can adjust the formatting of a theme on the Design tab.

2. Theme Variants-  Each theme has several different theme variations called Variants. A Variant is a preformatted design that changes the color, font, and background of the theme. When a theme is selected, the variations available for that particular theme appear in the Variants gallery on the Design tab.

3. Slide Size-  The default proportions of a PowerPoint slide are 16:9, Widescreen, which is perfectly sized to a wide presentation screen. Change the slide size to Standard, 4:3, to fit a smaller, narrower screen. You can further customize slide dimensions by using the Slide Size dialog box. It's important to make sure that the slide size in a presentation is formatted to the size of the screen it will be presented on, or else the presentation won't display properly and some information may be cut off from view.

4. Format Background-  The Format Background button opens the Format Background pane where you can modify the background of one or more slides in your presentation.

5. Theme Colors-  Additional theme color palette options are available for each theme in the Color drop down. You can preview the color options by resting your pointer on one of the options.

6. Theme Fonts-  A Theme's default font can be changed in the Font drop down. Rest your pointer on one of the font options to preview it.
</pre>
    <pre>
1. Background Fill:
    Options-  The Format Background pane presents a large variety of background fill options, including solid, gradient, picture, texture, and pattern fills. If using a texture, pattern, or picture, be sure to check that you can still read the slide content. When using pictures, make sure that the resolution of the image is high enough so the picture doesn't look distorted.

2. Background Color: The simplest and most common slide background choice is a solid color. Background color options are available in the Format Background pane.

3. Background
    Transparency: Background styles can significantly add to the visual appeal of a slide, but they can also take away from the design of a slide by distracting from content or making the content harder to read. One of the most effective ways to assure readability is to increase the transparency of the background image.
</pre>
    <pre>
1. Title Slide Layout:  The Title Slide layout contains a prominent title placeholder and a subtitle placeholder.

2. Title and Content
    Layout: The Title and Content layout contains a title placeholder and a content placeholder. A picture, video, table, chart, SmartArt, or text can be inserted into the content placeholder.

3. Two Content Layout: The Two Content layout contains a title placeholder and two content placeholders. A picture, video, table, chart, SmartArt, or text can be inserted into each of the content placeholders.

4. Blank Layout:  The Blank layout contains no placeholders. The blank slide layout is useful for when you want to customize the placement of each placeholder.   
</pre>
    <h3>6.4.6 Tips</h3>
    <pre>
Themes- When applying themes, consider the following:
    --Use a theme to ensure design consistency throughout your presentation.
    
    --If you are confident enough, try building your own theme from scratch, but if time is an issue, leave the design work to PowerPoint.
    
    --Experiment with theme variants until the theme looks the way you want it to.

Slide Size & Background:  When choosing the size and background for slides, keep in mind the following tips:
    --Make sure you've formatted your slide size to fit the screen that you will be using for your presentation. Otherwise, elements of the slide may be compromised, or may not even be visible.
    
    --When you're formatting slide backgrounds independent of a theme, make sure the backgrounds don't compromise the readability of the text.
    
    --If your background makes slide content unreadable, try adjusting the background transparency or adding background colors to text boxes.

    <h2>6.5 Using the Slide Master</h2>
    <h3>6.5.1 Slide Masters</h3>
    <h3>6.5.2 Slide Footers</h3>
    <h3>6.5.4 Facts</h3>
    <pre>
1. Insert Slide Master--  In certain situations, a single presentation may call for more than one Slide Master, such as when the presentation will use more than one theme or style. To add another Slide Master, click Insert Slide Master. When a second Slide Master is added to a presentation, it will appear below the first Slide Master in the Slides pane.

2. Insert Layout--  While PowerPoint offers default slide layouts, both inside and outside of the Slide Master, you can always create your own custom layout inside of the Slide Master. By doing this, you'll only have to create the custom layout once. Once you've inserted the new layout into the Slide Master by clicking Insert Layout, you can format the new layout to your liking.

3. Insert Placeholder--  Placeholders are already fixed in place on default slide layouts, but they can be easily moved, deleted, or inserted. Insert a content, text, picture, chart, table, SmartArt, video, or online picture placeholder by clicking Insert Placeholder.

4. Themes--  A theme may be applied outside of the Slide Master view, but applying it inside has a few advantages. Namely, you have more control over any additional formatting of the theme inside the Slide Master than you would outside. It's also much easier to add additional themes to the presentation in this view. Click Themes in the Edit Theme group and rest your cursor on a theme thumbnail to preview how it looks. To select a theme, click the theme thumbnail. Click Browse for Themes on the drop down to search for additional themes.

5. Close Master View--  The Slide Master view and tab are contextual. This means that the Slide Master tab doesn't appear unless you've clicked Slide Master on the View tab. To close the Slide Master and return to the default view, click Close Master View.

6. Slide Master--  The Slide Master itself is located at the left-hand side of the window. When you make changes to a slide master, its thumbnail will reflect those changes. Slide Masters are listed by layout and group. Clicking a slide thumbnail on the left will allow you to edit its content.

7. Title and Content Layout
    The Title and Content slide layout contains a title placeholder and a content placeholder by default.

8. Title Slide Layout--  The Title Slide layout contains a prominent title placeholder and a subtitle placeholder. This particular layout cannot be deleted.

9. Master Slide Text Styles
    Any style changes made to a Master Slide text style while the Slide Master tab is open will be applied to the entire PowerPoint presentation. For example, if the font size on the Title and Content Master Slide is changed, that change will apply to every occurrence of the Title and Content slide layout in the presentation.
    </pre>
    <h3>6.5.6 Tips</h3>
    <pre>
New Slide Masters-  When inserting new slide masters and layouts, consider the following:
    --If your presentation includes several sections (for example, if you're giving a presentation about the different stages of seed germination), you may want to use more than one Slide Master. This allows sections to be clearly defined by a completely different visual appearance.

    --PowerPoint might not have the specific layout you are looking for. In this case, try creating your own layout inside of the Slide Master, as opposed to creating one outside of it. That way your slide layout will be saved, and you won't have to recreate it or copy the slide later.

Themes-  When applying a theme to a Slide Master, consider the following:
    --Using Themes is always a good decision. Applying a theme ensures solid continuity and adds visual stimulation to a presentation.

    --Sometimes simply changing the variants of a theme will achieve the same effect as changing the entire theme. Doing this will clearly separate different sections of a presentation, while still retaining design continuity.
