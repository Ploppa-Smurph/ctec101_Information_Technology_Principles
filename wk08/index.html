    <h3>6.1.3 Overview</h3>
    <pre>
    Creating and Managing Presentations-- When making a PowerPoint presentation, you can either create a new presentation from scratch, or you can use a pre-designed template from PowerPoint's extensive template library. PowerPoint also provides numerous style presets that help you fine-tune your presentation to fit any subject or situation.
    
    Formatting Text within Placeholders-- PowerPoint uses placeholders to hold and format text. Placeholders can be moved anywhere on a slide and can be resized, rotated, and formatted in a variety of ways. The text contained within a placeholder can be stylized in much the same way as other Microsoft Office products.
    
    Slide Design--  In addition to a vast template library, PowerPoint provides you with several tools and features that will help you customize any presentation to fit your specific needs. You can even easily design a presentation from scratch by using PowerPoint's built-in style tools.
    
    The Slide Master--  By using the Slider Master view, you can quickly make layout changes to all the slides in your presentation at once. You can also make layout changes to a particular subset of slides. This is extremely helpful when your presentation has a large number of slides.
    
    Formatting SmartArt and Other Illustrations-- Similar to Word, PowerPoint allows you to insert all types of illustrations, including shapes and charts. You can also insert SmartArt graphics, which can be used to communicate different types of information, such as processes, relationships, and hierarchies. Illustrations can be formatted to fit into your presentation.
    
    Formatting Tables and Charts-- PowerPoint tables and charts help you organize information into a more readable and visually compelling format.
    
    Formatting Pictures and Media-- After inserting a picture, video, or other media element into your presentation, you can adjust its look by using an array of visual effects and formatting tools.
    
    Applying Animations-- Animations can help your audience pay close attention to particular ideas or graphical elements in your presentation. There are a variety of animation effects to choose from, ranging from simply appearing on the screen at a certain time to moving across the screen in a specified pattern.
    
    Applying Transitions-- Transitions between slides can vary from subtle fades to more dynamic effects, such as curtains, checkerboards, and even origami folds.
    
    Delivering Presentations-- After designing and entering the content for a presentation, the next step is to deliver your presentation to an audience, whether in person or online. To deliver a powerful presentation, use PowerPoint's Presenter View, which provides you with your personal notes for each slide, a timer, a laser pointer tool, a preview of the upcoming slide, a slide zoom option, and a blackout option.
    
    Printing Presentations and Handouts-- PowerPoint provides some unique print layout options, including printing full page slides, content outlines, notes pages for the presenter, and even handouts for the audience.

    File Tab Features
    <pre>
1. New:  To create a new presentation, click the New tab. You can create a new presentation using either a blank presentation or one of the pre-designed templates that best suits your needs.
2. Open:  On the Open tab, you can open a recently saved presentation, or you can browse your computer to find and open a previously saved presentation.
3. Save/Save As:  PowerPoint presentations can be saved as a number of different file types. Most of the time you will save a presentation as the default .pptx file. However, sometimes you might need to save your presentation in a different format. The Save As tab allows you to select a file type to save as from the Save as Type drop down. You can save your presentation as a PDF; an image, such as a JPG or PNG; and even a video. You can either save your files on your local machine, or if you have a OneDrive account you can save your flies to Microsoft's cloud storage service.
4. Properties:  The properties of a presentation provide metadata—information that describes the document. This information includes the presentation title, author name, tags, categories, and slide numbers, all of which identify the contents of the file. To modify a document's properties, go to the Info tab of the Backstage view and click on the property you want to edit.
</pre>
    <pre>
1. Paste Options:  When you copy content to the Clipboard, you can paste it elsewhere in your presentation by clicking the Paste button or using the keyboard shortcut Ctrl + V. Most of the time, text will bring its formatting (font size, font styles, and links) with it when it's pasted. To insert content from the Clipboard without any previous formatting, paste it as usual, and then click Paste Options, which will appear next to the pasted text. Click Keep Text Only. Paste Options can also be found by clicking the drop-down arrow below the Paste button in the Clipboard group.

2. Slides Tab:  The Slides tab displays a thumbnail of each slide in your presentation. This tab makes it easy to scroll quickly through your presentation and edit a particular slide.

3. Duplicate Slide:  To duplicate a slide, right-click the slide and click Duplicate Slide. The duplicate slide will be inserted below the original slide.

4. Delete Slide:  If you are certain that you do not need the content of a slide, right-click the slide and click Delete Slide. If there is a possibility that you may need the content later, consider hiding the slide instead.

5. Cut:  Slides themselves, or slide elements (such as text, graphics, and placeholders), can be deleted and moved to the Clipboard using the Cut command. The content can then be pasted somewhere else in the presentation, or even into another presentation. When you use the Cut command, the slide or slide element is deleted from its original place in the presentation. To use the Cut command, click the Cut button or use the keyboard shortcut Ctrl + X.

6. Undo or Redo:  To undo or redo an action in PowerPoint without having to delete or retype anything, use the Undo and Redo buttons in the Quick Access Toolbar.

7. Copy:  Almost all elements in PowerPoint can be copied. To copy something, either click the Copy button or use the keyboard shortcut Ctrl + C.

8. Create New Slide:  Every PowerPoint presentation has at least one slide, but you will always need more than one slide for a presentation. You can create additional slides by clicking the New Slide button. Use the New Slide drop down to select a slide layout.

9. Add Section:  Longer presentations may need to be divided into sections. A section is a group of slides within a presentation. Sections can be expanded or collapsed in the Slides tab, which makes working with longer presentations much easier. To add a new section to a presentation, click the Section drop down and click Add Section.

10. Slide Pane:  The Slide Pane displays the currently selected slide and allows you to edit text and other slide elements.

11. Hide Slide:  You may have a presentation that is longer than the time you have available to present. Rather than deleting slides to shorten the presentation, you can simply hide unessential slides, preventing them from displaying during a presentation. To hide a slide, right-click the slide and click Hide Slide. To unhide a slide, right-click the slide and click Hide Slide again. A hidden slide has a faded thumbnail and a slash through its number.

    <h3>6.2.6 Presentation Tips</h3>
    <pre>
Opening and Saving:   When opening and saving multiple presentations:
        --If you need to open a presentation other than the one you're working on, go to the Open tab in the Backstage view and browse for the file you want to open. You do not need to exit PowerPoint to open a different presentation.
        --It's important to save your presentation often. However, if PowerPoint or your computer crashes, remember that PowerPoint's AutoRecover feature saves your work every ten minutes. An auto-saved version of your presentation can be recovered the next time you open PowerPoint.
        --When you first save a file, the file name will automatically be set as the text in the first paragraph of the first slide. While the default file name might be okay, it's important to clearly name your presentation in order to easily find it later.

Copying and Pasting Slides:  Oftentimes it's much easier to copy or duplicate a slide and modify the content instead of creating a blank slide.
        --If you are copying a slide from one presentation to another, you'll want to paste the slide using the destination theme.
        --In some cases, you may want to copy and paste a slide as a picture that can then be placed within another slide.
        --If your purpose is to delete a slide and move it somewhere else, make sure you use the Cut command so a copy of the slide isn't left behind.

Lengthy Presentations:  Longer presentations can sometimes be hard to manage, but there are a few things you can do to make dealing with long presentations easier.
        --When working with a lengthy presentation, grouping slides into sections will keep your Slide tab clean and make it easier to scroll through. You can add titles to your sections to help you easily identify them.
        --You may be giving the same presentation to more than one audience. If one group needs to hear only part of the presentation, and the other group needs to hear all of it, try hiding slides to give a shorter presentation instead of creating two separate presentations.

    <h3>6.3.4 Formatting Tips</h3>
    <pre>
        
        1. Font-  Also called typeface or font family, font refers to a character set that is designed with a particular appearance. Examples include: Times New Roman, Arial, Courier New, and Palatino Linotype.
        
        2. Font Style-  Style usually refers to formatting, such as italic, bold, and bold italic. Regular font styles do not include additional formatting. To apply or remove a font style, simply select the text you wish to change and then click either the bold or italic button.
        
        3. Font Effects-  In addition to font styles, other effects can be applied to fonts, including underlining, double-underlining, strikethrough, subscript (X0), and superscript (X2).
        
        4. Font Size-  Fonts can be set to a particular size through the font size drop-down list. They can also be increased or decreased incrementally using the  buttons to the right of the drop-down list. The unit of measurement used for font sizes is the point.
        
        5. Font Case-  Case is the typographical term that distinguishes lowercase letters from UPPERCASE letters. Word provides other standard capitalization schemes: Sentence case capitalizes only the first word of a sentence; Title Case capitalizes the principal words in names or titles.
        
        6. Font Color-  The default font color for documents is black. To apply a different color, select one from the drop-down color gallery.
        
        7. Clear All Formatting-  Clear All Formatting clears all formatting (such as paragraph spacing, underline, bold, italics, and superscript) from selected text and paragraphs, returning them to their default formatting.
        
        8. Text Placeholder-  A text placeholder is a box with a dotted border. While there are several different kinds of placeholders—including placeholders for tables, pictures, online pictures, and SmartArt—text placeholders can hold only text. Apart from the Blank layout, default slide layouts already contain text placeholders. Click inside the placeholder to enter text or to edit existing text. To delete a placeholder, click the dotted border and press Backspace or Delete.  
    </pre>
    <pre>
    1. Bullets:  Bullet points draw attention to important information summarized as key points. Use the Bullets button to start a bulleted list. The default bullet style is a solid black circle. The Bullets drop-down gallery offers more bullet style options. If you want to use a bullet style that is not listed in the Bullet gallery, click Bullets and Numbering to create custom bullets. You can reformat existing paragraphs into a bulleted list by selecting the desired paragraphs and clicking the Bullets button.
        
    2. Numbering:  PowerPoint automatically begins a numbered list when you type 1 followed by a period or a close parenthesis, for example, 1. or 1), and then a space. You can also use the Numbering button and its drop-down gallery to manually create and format a numbered list. The Numbering drop-down gallery offers a variety of number formatting options. If the number format you need is not listed, click Bullets and Numbering to find more options. You can reformat existing paragraphs into a numbered list by selecting the desired paragraphs and clicking the Numbering button.
        
    3. Decrease/Increase
            Indent:  By default, lists in PowerPoint are not indented. However, you can change the indent of a list or paragraph by using the Decrease Indent and Increase Indent buttons. Below are the three types of indents that can be used:
                Left: The entire paragraph is indented a specified distance from the left of the page.
                First Line: Only the first line of the paragraph is indented.
                Hanging: All but the first line of the paragraph is indented a specified distance from the left of the page.
            Only left indents can be applied when using the Decrease Indent and Increase Indent buttons. Other indents are applied from the Paragraph dialog box.
        
    4. Line and Paragraph
            Spacing: Line spacing is the vertical distance between lines of text in a paragraph. Single- and double-spacing are the most common settings. However, there are other standard line spacing options, such as 1.25, and custom line spacing options, such as 1.80. Paragraph spacing is additional spacing before or after a paragraph.
        
    5. AlignmentParagraph alignment dictates how the body of the paragraph appears in relation to the left and right sides of a text box or placeholder. The default setting, Align Left, aligns content with the left side. Center aligns text with the center. Align Right aligns text with the right side. Justify aligns text with both the left and right sides.
        
    6. Align TextAs well as to the left, right, or horizontal center of the text box or placeholder, text can be aligned to the top, bottom, and vertical middle. 
    </pre> Text Insertion
    <pre>
1. Shapes:  Shapes are often used in PowerPoint presentations to point out or draw attention to specific information. For example, an arrow or star shape. Other types of shapes include callouts, flowcharts, and equation shapes. Enter text inside of a shape by right-clicking the shape and clicking Edit Text.

2. Text Box:  Use a text box to insert text anywhere on a slide without having to insert a placeholder. If the body of text being entered into a text box exceeds the dimensions of the box, the text box will automatically resize itself to fit the text.

3. Header & Footer:  The header and footer hold information placed at the top or bottom of a slide. For example, the date, author name, or slide number. Some header and footer content, such as date and page number, is formatted to automatically update if the presentation is opened at a later date or if additional slides are created.

4. Date & Time:  The date and time of the presentation's last edit can be added to the header or footer. The date and time can also be locked to display a specific day. In addition, the date and time can be set to update automatically by selecting the Update Automatically check box in the Date And Time dialog.

5. Slide Number:  The format and position of the slide number on each slide is determined by the layout of the chosen Slide Master.
</pre>
    <pre>
1. Text Box Margins:  Text box margins determine how far the text is spaced from the sides, top, and bottom of the text box. The smaller the margin, the more room for text.
2. Vertical Alignment:  Use the vertical alignment settings on the Text Options tab in the Format Shape pane or the Align Text drop down on the Home tab to align text vertically to the top, bottom, and middle of the page.
3. Autofit Settings:  Select one of the Autofit options to change how text interacts with the text box. Autofit options include Do not Autofit, Shrink text on overflow, and Resize shape to fit text.

    <h3>6.3.7 Formatting Tips</h3>
    <pre>
Style and Layout of Text:  Unless a presentation is image-based, the text is the most important element of each slide. When selecting the overall style and layout of text, remember the following:
    --The way your content is designed will have a profound effect on the interest of your audience, even if the information is otherwise boring or monotonous. However, don't rely solely on your design—your content should still be well thought out.
    
    --Slides that contain a bulleted or numbered list are a lot easier to read than slides containing a block of content. Lists are great for things like character names, biographical facts, discussion points, and reading questions. Numbered lists in particular are useful for chronological points. Bullet points formatted as questions are a great way to generate group conversation.
    
    --Make sure to align placeholders with each other so the text looks uniform. Side-by-side placeholders look much better if they're aligned with their neighbors. The placeholders on preformatted layouts are already aligned, but you can move them if you need to.

Fonts:   When modifying fonts, keep in mind the following tips:
    --Selecting a legible font is extremely important. In general, stay away from decorative fonts unless you're only formatting one large word with few letters. Never use a decorative font if the presentation is intended for a professional setting. When in doubt, classic fonts (such as Times New Roman or Arial) are always a good choice.
    
    --In an academic paper, italics are sometimes okay to use, but bold, underlined, highlighted, and colored text are usually not. However, in a PowerPoint presentation you can use any of them in moderation.
    
    --Bold text can draw attention to a particular part of a slide. So can making the text a different color, putting a highlight behind it, and using italics. But be careful not to overuse font effects or color choices. Too many styles will detract from the content rather than add to it.

    <h2>6.4 Designing Slides</h2>
    <h3>Themes and Templates</h3> themes changes colors, fonts and layouts... templates offers even more pre customized options
    <h3>Slide Backgrounds</h3>
    <h3>6.4.3 Slide Design Facts</h3>
    <pre>
1. Presentation Themes-  PowerPoint themes are sets of design components that include background color and pattern, font styles, and placeholder layouts. Applying a theme to a presentation is a quick way to give it a polished look. Because a theme applies immediately to an entire presentation, the design process is significantly simplified. If needed, you can adjust the formatting of a theme on the Design tab.

2. Theme Variants-  Each theme has several different theme variations called Variants. A Variant is a preformatted design that changes the color, font, and background of the theme. When a theme is selected, the variations available for that particular theme appear in the Variants gallery on the Design tab.

3. Slide Size-  The default proportions of a PowerPoint slide are 16:9, Widescreen, which is perfectly sized to a wide presentation screen. Change the slide size to Standard, 4:3, to fit a smaller, narrower screen. You can further customize slide dimensions by using the Slide Size dialog box. It's important to make sure that the slide size in a presentation is formatted to the size of the screen it will be presented on, or else the presentation won't display properly and some information may be cut off from view.

4. Format Background-  The Format Background button opens the Format Background pane where you can modify the background of one or more slides in your presentation.

5. Theme Colors-  Additional theme color palette options are available for each theme in the Color drop down. You can preview the color options by resting your pointer on one of the options.

6. Theme Fonts-  A Theme's default font can be changed in the Font drop down. Rest your pointer on one of the font options to preview it.
</pre>
    <pre>
1. Background Fill:
    Options-  The Format Background pane presents a large variety of background fill options, including solid, gradient, picture, texture, and pattern fills. If using a texture, pattern, or picture, be sure to check that you can still read the slide content. When using pictures, make sure that the resolution of the image is high enough so the picture doesn't look distorted.

2. Background Color: The simplest and most common slide background choice is a solid color. Background color options are available in the Format Background pane.

3. Background
    Transparency: Background styles can significantly add to the visual appeal of a slide, but they can also take away from the design of a slide by distracting from content or making the content harder to read. One of the most effective ways to assure readability is to increase the transparency of the background image.
</pre>
    <pre>
1. Title Slide Layout:  The Title Slide layout contains a prominent title placeholder and a subtitle placeholder.

2. Title and Content
    Layout: The Title and Content layout contains a title placeholder and a content placeholder. A picture, video, table, chart, SmartArt, or text can be inserted into the content placeholder.

3. Two Content Layout: The Two Content layout contains a title placeholder and two content placeholders. A picture, video, table, chart, SmartArt, or text can be inserted into each of the content placeholders.

4. Blank Layout:  The Blank layout contains no placeholders. The blank slide layout is useful for when you want to customize the placement of each placeholder.   
</pre>
    <h3>6.4.6 Tips</h3>
    <pre>
Themes- When applying themes, consider the following:
    --Use a theme to ensure design consistency throughout your presentation.
    
    --If you are confident enough, try building your own theme from scratch, but if time is an issue, leave the design work to PowerPoint.
    
    --Experiment with theme variants until the theme looks the way you want it to.

Slide Size & Background:  When choosing the size and background for slides, keep in mind the following tips:
    --Make sure you've formatted your slide size to fit the screen that you will be using for your presentation. Otherwise, elements of the slide may be compromised, or may not even be visible.
    
    --When you're formatting slide backgrounds independent of a theme, make sure the backgrounds don't compromise the readability of the text.
    
    --If your background makes slide content unreadable, try adjusting the background transparency or adding background colors to text boxes.

    <h2>6.5 Using the Slide Master</h2>
    <h3>6.5.1 Slide Masters</h3>
    <h3>6.5.2 Slide Footers</h3>
    <h3>6.5.4 Facts</h3>
    <pre>
1. Insert Slide Master--  In certain situations, a single presentation may call for more than one Slide Master, such as when the presentation will use more than one theme or style. To add another Slide Master, click Insert Slide Master. When a second Slide Master is added to a presentation, it will appear below the first Slide Master in the Slides pane.

2. Insert Layout--  While PowerPoint offers default slide layouts, both inside and outside of the Slide Master, you can always create your own custom layout inside of the Slide Master. By doing this, you'll only have to create the custom layout once. Once you've inserted the new layout into the Slide Master by clicking Insert Layout, you can format the new layout to your liking.

3. Insert Placeholder--  Placeholders are already fixed in place on default slide layouts, but they can be easily moved, deleted, or inserted. Insert a content, text, picture, chart, table, SmartArt, video, or online picture placeholder by clicking Insert Placeholder.

4. Themes--  A theme may be applied outside of the Slide Master view, but applying it inside has a few advantages. Namely, you have more control over any additional formatting of the theme inside the Slide Master than you would outside. It's also much easier to add additional themes to the presentation in this view. Click Themes in the Edit Theme group and rest your cursor on a theme thumbnail to preview how it looks. To select a theme, click the theme thumbnail. Click Browse for Themes on the drop down to search for additional themes.

5. Close Master View--  The Slide Master view and tab are contextual. This means that the Slide Master tab doesn't appear unless you've clicked Slide Master on the View tab. To close the Slide Master and return to the default view, click Close Master View.

6. Slide Master--  The Slide Master itself is located at the left-hand side of the window. When you make changes to a slide master, its thumbnail will reflect those changes. Slide Masters are listed by layout and group. Clicking a slide thumbnail on the left will allow you to edit its content.

7. Title and Content Layout
    The Title and Content slide layout contains a title placeholder and a content placeholder by default.

8. Title Slide Layout--  The Title Slide layout contains a prominent title placeholder and a subtitle placeholder. This particular layout cannot be deleted.

9. Master Slide Text Styles
    Any style changes made to a Master Slide text style while the Slide Master tab is open will be applied to the entire PowerPoint presentation. For example, if the font size on the Title and Content Master Slide is changed, that change will apply to every occurrence of the Title and Content slide layout in the presentation.
    </pre>
    <h3>6.5.6 Tips</h3>
    <pre>
New Slide Masters-  When inserting new slide masters and layouts, consider the following:
    --If your presentation includes several sections (for example, if you're giving a presentation about the different stages of seed germination), you may want to use more than one Slide Master. This allows sections to be clearly defined by a completely different visual appearance.

    --PowerPoint might not have the specific layout you are looking for. In this case, try creating your own layout inside of the Slide Master, as opposed to creating one outside of it. That way your slide layout will be saved, and you won't have to recreate it or copy the slide later.

Themes-  When applying a theme to a Slide Master, consider the following:
    --Using Themes is always a good decision. Applying a theme ensures solid continuity and adds visual stimulation to a presentation.

    --Sometimes simply changing the variants of a theme will achieve the same effect as changing the entire theme. Doing this will clearly separate different sections of a presentation, while still retaining design continuity.

    <h2>6.6 Formatting SmartArt and Shapes</h2>
    <h3>6.6.1 SmartArt</h3>
    <h3>6.6.2 Object Formatting</h3>
    <h3>6.63 SmartArt and Shape Facts</h3>
    <pre>
1. Table-  Tables organize data into a more readable and easier to comprehend format. The Table tool on the Insert tab provides an easy-to-use grid to define the initial table dimensions. If you don't know exactly what the dimensions of your table need to be, you can always insert additional rows and columns later.

2. Shapes-  Shapes are often used in PowerPoint presentations to point out or draw attention to specific information. For example, an arrow or star shape. To create a shape, click Shapes in the Illustrations group. Click and drag to create the shape size you want. To create a circle, a square, or another regular shape, hold down the Shift key while clicking and dragging.

3. SmartArt-  Using SmartArt is one of the best ways to visually represent ideas. SmartArt is commonly used to show steps in a process, to demonstrate connections, or to visually organize information that isn't organized sequentially. To select a piece of SmartArt, click SmartArt in the Illustrations group.

4. Chart-  Charts are an excellent way to visually organize data. With a chart, it is easy to show trends, patterns, and relationships. Choose a chart type by clicking Chart in the Illustrations group.
</pre>
    <pre>
1. Quick Styles-  A theme assigns a presentation a set of overall colors, fonts, and designs. In addition, a theme also applies styles to illustrations and tables in a slide. However, you can change the default style of an illustration or table by clicking a thumbnail in Shape Style gallery.

2. Fill Color-  Use the Shape Fill drop down to change the fill color of an illustration or table. Make sure that the fill color doesn't make the illustration, table, or any information inside of the shape hard to see.

3. Outline Color-  Use the Shape Outline drop down to change the outline color of an illustration or table.

4. WordArt-  WordArt can add emphasis to a selection of text by adding a shadow, reflection, or 3-D effect. When a piece of text is converted to WordArt, it is still editable. Convert text to WordArt and modify it using the tools in the WordArt Styles group.

5. Stacking Order-  PowerPoint objects are each placed on their own level, or layer, and as objects are added, those layers build upwards from the bottom. This behavior causes illustrations and graphics, as well as pictures, to overlap each other. Sometimes you may overlap objects on purpose. For instance, you may want to place a piece of SmartArt over a graphic, or a graphic over a shape. To reorder the layers of PowerPoint objects, select the object you wish to move and click Bring Forward or Send Backward in the Arrange group.

6. Alignment Options-  In addition to the left, right, or horizontal center of a slide, a placeholder may be aligned to the top, bottom, or vertical center of a slide. Use the Align drop down in the Arrange group to accomplish this.

7. Grouping Options-   Grouping objects allows you to rotate, move, or resize all objects as if they were one shape. This can be useful if you have a set of objects that have been perfectly aligned in relation to each other but need to be moved to a different part of the slide without changing their alignment.
</pre>
    <h3>SmartArt and Shape Tips</h3>
    <pre>
SmartArt--  When inserting and formatting SmartArt, consider the following:
    --In addition to PowerPoint, SmartArt is available in both Word and Excel.
    
    --Choose an appropriate SmartArt layout for your content. For example, if want to display a company organization chart, explore options within the Hierarchy and Relationship categories.
    
    --To help you choose an appropriate SmartArt layout, read the layout descriptions within the Choose a SmartArt Graphic dialog box. If they are not carefully chosen, SmartArt layouts can confuse your audience.

Illustrations--  Illustrations and other graphical data should be formatted to enhance the presentation, not detract from it.
    --If ClipArt, SmartArt, or pictures don't meet criteria, you can create your own list, process, hierarchy graphics, or even simple pictures, using one or more Shapes.
    
    --Make sure that the colors you incorporate into your shapes, WordArt, ClipArt, tables, and charts are cohesive with the colors in the design of the presentation.
    
    --If you choose a theme for your presentation, it may automatically choose a format for the objects in the presentation. You can change the formatting of objects at any time.

    <h3>6.7.3 Table and Chart Formatting Facts</h3>
    <pre>
        1. Delete Rows/Columns--  You can't delete a row or column by selecting it and pressing Delete. This will clear the cell contents, but leave the cells intact. To delete a whole row or column, use this button.
        
        2. Insert Rows/Columns--  Use this to add new rows or columns to your table.
        
        3. Merge/Split Cells--  Merging cells takes two or more cells and combines them into one. Splitting cells takes a selection of cells and divides them into multiple columns or rows.
        
        4. Cell Size--  The easiest way to resize a row or column is by dragging its border. However, if you want to resize them to an exact measurement, you can do that using these boxes.
        
        5. Cell Alignment--  These six buttons determine where in the cell your text will appear. In the image above, the text will appear at the top left of the selected cell. 
</pre>
    <pre>
        1. Table Style Options-  The check boxes in this group can be used to modify the appearance of tables. For example, the Banded Rows check box allows you to have rows that alternate colors, which can increase the table's readability.
        
        2. Table Styles Gallery-  Tables are formatted plainly by default, but many different table styles are available here. To preview how a style will change the appearance of your table, hover the cursor over the style.
        
        3. Cell Borders-  The default border style of a table is a single black line, but a border's color, thickness, and line style can all be changed. Table styles usually apply their own border styles.
</pre>
    <pre>
    1. Chart Elements-  Chart elements are the "pieces" of a chart, such as the title, legends, axis labels, and error bars. Using this menu, you can add, customize, and remove elements from your chart.
    
    2. Chart Styles Gallery-  This gallery has a variety of preformatted styles you can apply to your chart. These styles will automatically update to match the current theme of your presentation.
    
    3. Select Data-  This option opens the Select Data Source dialog box. From here, you can choose which data to include or exclude, switch rows and columns, and customize which data are used as labels.
    
    4. Edit Data-  This button opens the spreadsheet that holds your data. The bottom half of the button has the option to open and edit the data in Excel.
    
    5. Change Chart Type-  Use this to change your chart into a different type. Remember to always use an appropriate chart type for your data. 
</pre>
    <h3>6.7.6 Table and Chart Formatting Tips</h3>
    <pre>
Tables:  When creating tables:
    --Always use a table or chart to display numerical data or technical information, such as the results of a science experiment. Table and chart formatting make types of information such as these much easier for your audience to understand and remember.
    --Don't try to fit too much information on a single slide. If possible, display the table in the venue where you will give the presentation. If it's difficult to read or interpret, scale it back to include less text.
    --Experiment with Table Style Options, such as a different first column and banded rows, until you find the design that works best with your data.
    --Apply table styles that complement the overall theme of the presentation.

Charts:  When creating charts:
    --Use the right kind of chart for your data. For example, line charts should only be used to show change over time. If you use a line chart to represent categorical data, it will confuse your audience.
    --By using PowerPoint's prebuilt themes and chart styles, you can quickly and easily create charts that are informative and visually-appealing.

    <h2>6.8 Formatting Pictures and Other Media</h2>
    <h3>6.8.1 Media Formatting</h3>
    inserting pictures and videos
    <h3>Advanced Media Formatting</h3>
    Color Correction, Cutting a video clips time, audio clips, compressing media and packaging media for CD
    <h3>6.8.3 Media Formatting Facts</h3>
    <pre>
        1. Pictures-- Click Pictures to insert an image saved on your computer. Once you have located the graphic that you want to insert, select it and click Insert. The picture or graphic will appear in the current slide.
        
        2. Online Pictures--  If you don't have the picture you need on your computer, you can insert a picture from the Internet by clicking Online Pictures, which opens a window where you can search for a specific type of picture. You can either search the Internet or Microsoft's online ClipArt library. When you find a suitable picture, select it and click Insert.
        
        3. Video--  PowerPoint also allows you to insert media, such as videos, into your presentation. Click Video to insert a video saved on your computer or a video from the Internet. When inserting an online video, you can either search for it on YouTube or paste its embed code.
        
        4. Audio--  Occasionally, rather than for professional or educational purposes, a PowerPoint presentation is created for entertainment. Such types of presentations may call for music. Additionally, some teachers will record their lecture over a presentation so that it may be listened to along with the slides at a later time. You can add music or narration to a presentation by clicking Audio.
        
        5. Screen Recording--  PowerPoint has the ability to insert screen captures from your computer into a presentation. This is particularly useful when you want to create a video showing how to do something on a computer. Once in the presentation, screen captures can be formatted like any other video file.
</pre>
    <pre>
        1. Corrections-  Sometimes photos are taken in poor lighting conditions or have other imperfections. Luckily, the Corrections drop down allows you to change the sharpness, brightness, and contrast of a picture. Sharpen/Soften can help make a photo stand out more. Brightness/Contrast can help make a picture easier to see if it is under or over exposed.
        
        2. Picture Styles Gallery-  Picture Styles are additional visual formatting options that you can add to an object, such as borders, shadows, reflections, and even 3-D effects. Click one of the thumbnails in the Picture Styles gallery to apply that style. Picture styles override each other, meaning you can only have one style type applied to a picture.
        
        3. Picture Border-  To change the default border style on a picture, click Picture Border and select a new border style from the drop down.
        
        4. Artistic Effects-  Artistic effects can make an image look like a painting, a drawing, or another art style. Only one artistic effect can be added to a picture at a time. Rest your cursor on an artistic effect thumbnail in the Artistic Effects drop down to preview it, and click the thumbnail to apply it.
        
        5. Picture Effects-  Picture effects are additional visual formatting options that can be applied to an object, such as outer glow, beveled edges, or 3-D rotation. Click Picture Effects to view the available effects you can add to an image.
</pre>
    <pre>
1. Align-  Use Align to change the placement of selected objects in a presentation. Objects can be aligned to the top, middle, bottom, or other areas of the document.

2. Crop-  Cropping a picture adjusts its visible areas, while retaining its size and resolution. A picture can be cropped by clicking Crop in the Size group and dragging one of the cropping handles. When cropping, be careful not to hide any important content.

3. Size-  Resize pictures and other objects to exact specifications by using the Height and Width boxes in the Size group. If you don't need to be exact, you can resize a picture by selecting it and moving your cursor to one of the resize squares until the double-pointed arrow appears. You can then click and drag to make the picture larger or smaller.
</pre>
    <pre>
    1. Video Start Options-  You'll often want to have manual control over the timing of your presentation. Most people use a remote to move from slide to slide, holding it in their hand and clicking each time they want to move to the next slide or slide object. If the presentation is playing on its own, Start On Click is probably not the best option. Use the Start drop-down menu in the Video Options group to control whether the presentation has set timing or manually controlled timing.
    
    2. Video Editing-  Generate a fade effect for a video by using the Fade In and Fade Out buttons in the Editing group.
    
    3. Other Playback
        Options-  Playback options beyond Start On Click in the Video Options group include Play Full Screen, Hide While Not Playing, Loop until Stopped, and Rewind after Playing. 
</pre>
    <h3>6.8.6 Advanced Media Formatting Tips</h3>
    <pre>
    Image Selection-  When selecting an appropriate image to add to a presentation:
        --Consider the tone of a presentation when selecting images to incorporate. For example, inserting a stock photo into a business presentation might be a better choice than a cartoon.
    
        --Take note of copyright issues when using pictures and video from the Internet. Even if the image is public on the Internet, it may still be copyrighted. Sometimes the creator of the image or video will have use restrictions, such as requiring you to add an attribute to the borrowed image in your slide. Alternatively, you can contact the author and ask permission to use a graphic or photo.
    
        --Consider taking your own pictures and creating your own graphics.
    
    Image Formatting-  When formatting images, keep in mind the following tips:
        --Make sure that images are properly aligned with other elements of the slide. Improper alignment can be distracting.
    
        --If you find the perfect image but it's far too big for the slide, or there's a lot of unnecessary background space, use Crop to trim the edges.
    
        --Use the Corrections tool to make photos and images more professional.
    
        --The Artistic Effects gallery has a lot of neat effects, but don't overuse them.
    
    ClipArt, Audio, and Video-  Here are a few tips for working with other media:
        --Do not overuse ClipArt. Using many pieces of ClipArt from random searches can easily result in a disjointed and distracting presentation for your audience. Use discretion when you use ClipArt.
        
        --You can use an audio clip to draw the audience's attention to a particular area of a presentation, or even to play a song the entire presentation. When you add audio to your presentation, make sure to test the sound before the presentation begins.
        
        --It's a good idea to leave a video as it is. Adding effects to a video is usually unnecessary and can introduce a lot of problems.

    <h2>6.9 Animations, Transitions, Slide Zooms</h2>
    <h3>6.9.4 3D Models</h3>
    <h3>6.9.5 Animation and Transition Facts</h3>
    <pre>
1. Animation Preview-  To watch a live preview of an animation that is applied to a slide, click the Preview button.

2. Animation Gallery-  The Animation gallery displays all animation options. Applying animation effects to text or an object controls how they appear on the slide during the presentation. By default, text remains stationary on slides, but with an animation applied, text can appear one letter, word, or paragraph at a time. Both objects and text can be set up to fade in, appear in pieces, change color, dim, or even bounce onto the screen. There are four types of animations: entrance, exit, emphasis, and motion. Click the drop-down arrow to view the effects. Rest your cursor on one of the thumbnails to preview the effect.

3. Effect Options-  Unique options are available for each animation. For example, when the Fly In animation is applied, you can choose which direction the object or text flies in from using Effect Options.

4. Effect Options
    Dialog Boxes-  View additional unique animation formatting options by using the Effect Options dialog box.
</pre>
    <pre>
        1. Entrance Effects-  Entrance Effects determine the way in which objects appear on a slide.
        
        2. Emphasis Effects-  Emphasis Effects accentuate and draw attention to an object on a slide. For example, applying the Spin effect will cause the object to spin in place.
        
        3. Exit Effects-  Exit Effects determine the way in which objects exit a slide.
        
        4. Motion Paths-  Motion Paths move objects along a path, or line, that you specify. Motion paths can be combined with other effects.
            3D AnimationsPowerPoint has several animations that can be applied only to 3D models. These animations are indicated by a cube icon in the gallery and are available only when a 3D model is selected.  
</pre>
    <pre>
        1. Trigger-  A trigger is something that, when clicked, starts an animation. Click Trigger to choose which item will be the trigger for an animation.
        2. Animation Pane-  View all effects on the current slide using the Animation Pane, which offers timing, speed, reordering, and start options for animations.
        3. Timing-  Use Timing to decide whether the selected animation begins On Click, With Previous, or After Previous.
        4. Reorder Animation
            Options-  When a slide contains multiple animations, they may get applied in the wrong order. To reorder an animation, select it and click either Move Earlier or Move Later.
        5. Add Animation-  Click Add Animation to add an animation. This option performs the same task as Animation Effects Gallery.
        6. Duration-  The Duration value determines how long an animation will run.
        7. Delay-  Control when an animation will start by adjusting the Delay value.
</pre>
    <pre>
1. Duration-  Control the length of a transition by adjusting the Duration value.

2. Sound-  PowerPoint offers a long list of sounds that you can add to your transitions. Select a sound from the Sound drop down to add a sound to a transition. Be sure not to overuse sounds or use sounds that are too distracting.

3. Advance Slide Options-  You can decide whether you want the presentation to move by itself or on your clicks. Use the options below Advance Slide to choose when and how the slide should change.

4. Transition Preview-  Slide transitions are animated movements between slides in a presentation. While animations apply to objects on a slide, transitions apply to the slides themselves. Click Transition Preview to preview a transition that has been applied to a slide.

5. Transition Effects-  The Transition Effects gallery holds all transition effect options. Click the drop-down arrow to view all of the transition effects. Click one of the effect thumbnails to preview that effect.

6. Effect Options-  Unique options are available for each transition. For example, when the Push transition is applied, you can choose which direction the object or text is pushed in by selecting an option from the Effect Options drop down.

7. Apply to All-  To apply one transition style to all slides in a presentation, select the transition in the Transition Effects gallery and click Apply to All in the Timing group.
</pre>
    <pre>
        Slide Zoom- Slide Zoom is a feature that lets you create one large slide with several smaller slides on it. When you click one of the smaller slides, the presentation "zooms" into it. By default, the presentation will zoom from slide to slide until it's gone through them all. To insert a zoom slide, click Insert > Zoom > Slide Zoom.
        1. Change Image- By default, each zoom slide thumbnail is a smaller version of the complete slide. Using this button, you can change the slide thumbnails to any image.
        2. Return to Zoom-  If this option is checked, the slideshow will return back to the original slide instead of transitioning to the next slide. This is especially useful for creating nonlinear presentations.
        3. Zoom Transition-  Adding zoom slides is the only way to use PowerPoint's Zoom transition, which is enabled by default. If you want to use a different transition, uncheck this box.
        4. Duration-  This option lets you choose how long it takes to transition to the next slide.   
</pre>
    <h3>Animation and Transition Tips</h3>
    <pre>
Selecting Animations and Transitions-  When selecting animations and transitions:
    --Stick to stationary animations or transitions when creating a professional presentation. Use transitions similar to Appear and Fade, which still add emphasis to an object but are short, simple, and don't involve a lot of movement. Avoid animations with a lot of movement, such as Fly In, Bounce, Swivel, or Float In.
    --Use just a few animations and transition choices in one presentation. Choose animations that work well together and use them throughout your presentation. For consistency, it's usually best to use one transition throughout your entire presentation.
    --Use Apply to All to quickly apply one transition to an entire presentation.

Timing Options-   When modifying timing options for animations and transitions, keep in mind the following:
    --Even if you've memorized and timed your presentation beforehand, having your animations and transitions start after a set amount of time still might not be the best option. Keeping the trigger as a mouse click will allow you to pause while expanding on specific ideas, accounting for technical problems, or giving the audience time to take notes.
    --Keep animation durations short. A safe duration for most animations is between 2 and 4 seconds. When in doubt, stick to the default duration.
    --When it comes to more complicated transitions (such as the Origami transition), make sure to allot enough time for the transition to finish its movements. Decreasing the default duration may make the transition seem rushed.

Additional Tips-  Become familiar with the tools and various options related to animations and transitions.
    --Track animations using the Animation Pane. If there are multiple animations on a particular slide, they may activate in the wrong order. View and reorder a visual list of them in the Animation Pane.
    --Remember the difference between Duration, Delay, and Trigger. Duration controls the length of the animation or transition itself. Delay controls the length of time before the animation or transition begins. The Trigger controls when the animation (including the set Delay and Duration periods) will begin.

    <h3>6.10.1 Presentation Tools</h3>>
    <h3>6.10.2 PowerPoint Print Options</h3>
    <h3>6.10.3 Advanced Slide Show Options</h3>
    <h3>6.10.4 Presentation Delivery Facts</h3>
    <pre>
1. Spelling-  Before delivering your presentation, be sure to run the spelling and grammar checker. If spelling or grammar errors are found, the Spelling Pane appears on the right side of the presentation and displays suggested corrections. Click Ignore to ignore the word once. Click Ignore All to ignore every occurrence of the word in the presentation. Click Add to add the word or phrase to the Office dictionary. Click Change to make the suggested change, and click Change All to make the suggested change in every instance of the misspelled word.

2. Thesaurus-  PowerPoint's Thesaurus tool will help you to find synonyms for words. When you click the Thesaurus button, the Thesaurus pane will appear on the right side of the window. Type the word you want to find a synonym for in the Synonyms await... box. Synonyms for the word will appear in the box below.

3. Comments-  The Comments feature allows multiple people to review the content of a presentation and give feedback through comments. Reviewers can reply to comments to create an ongoing conversation about the presentation.
</pre>
    <pre>
        1. Printer Selection- You may already be connected to more than one printer; for example, the printer you use at school and the printer you use at home. The default printer will be displayed by name under Printer, but you can easily select a non-default printer to use. To select a non-default printer, simply select the printer from the Printer drop-down list (you may need to add the printer to your computer's configuration first).
    
        2. Slide Range- In some instances, you may want to print only a portion of a presentation, as opposed to all of its slides. In the Print tab under Settings, type the slide range you'd like to print in the Slides box with a dash between them (e.g., 3-7) and only those slides will print. If you want to print a series of slides that are not concurrent (e.g., 3, 5, 8), place a comma between each slide number. Any custom slide range you enter will not be saved the next time you open the presentation.
    
        3. Print Layout Options- PowerPoint provides some unique print layout options. These include printing full page slides, content outlines, and notes pages for the presenter. Nine additional layouts are available for printing handouts for the audience.
    
        4. Paper Collation- If you are printing multiple copies of a presentation, you have two options for how the slides will be printed: Collated or Uncollated. With the Collated setting, the presentation will fully print before the next copy is printed, keeping the slides in order. With the Uncollated setting, the printer will print each slide the specified number of times before printing the next slide. This requires you to manually sort the printed slides. PowerPoint prints collated copies by default, which is usually the best choice.
    
        5. Paper Orientation-  There are two types of page orientation. PowerPoint's default orientation setting for full-page slides is Landscape, where the long edge of the paper is horizontal. Presentations can also be printed in Portrait orientation, which is the default orientation for notes, outlines, and handouts.
    
        6. Color Options- If you are printing from a color printer, you can choose to print a presentation in color, grayscale, or pure black and white. You'll most often want to print handouts in either grayscale or black and white. The black and white option removes any color background that you've included on your slides and changes the font color to black.
    
        7. Header and Footer
            Dialog Box- The Header and Footer dialog box allows you to add the current date and time, slide or page number, and other information to your printed slides or handouts. The position of information placed on the header or footer is determined by the Slide Master and Handout Master layouts.   
</pre>
    <pre>
1. Start Slide Show- The easiest way to start a slide show from the beginning of the presentation is to press the F5 key. You can also click the Start From Beginning button on the Quick Access Toolbar or From Beginning on the Slide Show tab. To start the slide show from the current slide, you can either click From Current Slide or press Shift + F5. Other options let you present online over the Web or through Microsoft Lync.

2. Rehearse Timings- To ensure that your presentation doesn't run too long, you can practice your delivery using a timer. The timing for each slide can be saved and then used to automatically advance slides the next time you start the slide show.

3. Record Slide Show- This option lets you record a presentation for later viewing. In addition to recording the timing for transitions and animations, you can also record PowerPoint's built-in laser pointer (available in Presenter View) and audio narration (if you have a microphone installed on your computer).

4. Monitor Selection-  This drop down lets you manually select the monitor or projector on which your PowerPoint presentation will be displayed. Most of the time you can rely on the Automatic selection to locate the desired monitor.

5. Presenter View- With the Presenter View option selected, your audience will see a full screen display of each slide in the presentation. While the audience views the full screen slides from a projector or on a monitor, PowerPoint will display a number of presenter tools that only you can see on your computer monitor. This personal view displays your notes for each slide, the timer, a laser pointer tool, a preview of the upcoming slide, a slide zoom option, and a blackout option. If you are running a slide show at your computer and have only one monitor, you will need to right-click the slide and select Show Presenter View to experiment with this view.

6. Speaker Notes-  This button opens a small area below each slide where you can enter notes that will not be seen by your audience. You can either print these notes next to each slide or you can refer to them in Presenter View.
</pre>
    <pre>
1. Show Type-  This menu lets you choose between three types of slide shows. Each one is best suited for a different purpose.
    --Presented by a speaker is the default setting. When this option is selected, the slide show will be presented in full screen onto the slide show monitor (which is often a projector or large screen for an audience). This is the best show type to use when using your slide show as a backdrop for an in-person presentation.
    --Browsed by an individual runs the slide show in the current PowerPoint window. Since the presentation is windowed, it can be resized, minimized, and moved around the screen. This show type is useful when browsing through a show by yourself, as you can run other applications at the same time.
    --Browsed at a kiosk automatically loops a presentation. When this option is selected, the slide show cannot be manually advanced. This option should only be used when the slide show is configured to play by itself, because otherwise it will be stuck at the first slide.

2. Show Options-  This section includes the following options:
    --Loop continuously until 'Esc' causes the slide show to loop back to the first slide at the end of the presentation instead of ending the show. When the Browsed at a kiosk show type is selected, this option is automatically enabled.
    --Show without narration shows the slide show as normal, but without playing any prerecorded narration.
    --Show without animation removes all animations from the slide show. However, transitions between slides will still be shown.
    --Disable hardware graphics acceleration will route video processing for the slide show to the CPU instead of an independent video processor. This box should almost always remain unchecked, and is generally only used when a video processor has a faulty driver that cannot be replaced.
    --Pen color and Laser pointer color change the color of the pen and laser pointer used in a presentation.

3. Show Slides- This section includes the following options:
    --All, the default option, shows all slides in the presentation.
    --From lets you choose a range of slides to show.
    --Custom show lets you use a previously defined slide order. Refer to the Advanced Slide Show Options video in this section for more information about custom shows.

4. Advance Slides- This section includes the following options:
    --Manually requires you to manually advance slides, ignoring slide timings.
    --Using timings, if present is the default setting. Slides will advance according to slide timings, but can still be advanced manually.

5. Multiple Monitors- This section includes the following options:
    --Slide show monitor lets you choose which monitor (or projector) will show the presentation.
    --Resolution lets you choose the screen resolution of your presentation. In most cases, you'll want to show your presentation in the same resolution as the presentation monitor.
</pre>
    <h3>6.10.7 Presentations Tips</h3>
    <pre>
    Printing a Presentation-  When preparing a presentation for printing, become familiar with the various printing options.
        --The print preview will show you what your presentation will look like when printed.
        --The page selection setting lets you print only a portion of the presentation, such as the current slide or a small range of slides.
        --Other printing settings allow you to choose a different printer, select two-sided printing, print multiple slides per page, and pick the page orientation.
    
    Creating Handouts-  Use these guidelines to create a handout:
        --Printing presentations in Black and White can be useful when slide backgrounds are dark enough that they, when printed, will obscure text. The Black and White printing option removes any color background included on slides and changes all text to black.
        --Add your name to the header or footer of your presentation handout before printing it so your audience knows that you are the presenter. This is also helpful to teachers, who may have large stacks of printer handouts from multiple students.
    
    Delivering your Presentation- Use the following strategies to ensure a smooth presentation:
        --Verbally rehearse your presentation at least once before you give it to an audience. It's important to double-check the verbal part of the presentation, as well as the presentation's slide content and timing.
        --Use the slide show view to practice your presentation instead of just shuffling through the slides as you did when creating the presentation. Doing this allows you to see every animation and transition, as well as spot any spacing or design issues.
        --Use the speaker notes available at the bottom of the window. They eliminate the need for holding papers or notecards during the presentation.
